    <h1>How to Make a Wide Door Lining for Underfloor Heating</h1>
    
    <p>When installing underfloor heating, it's crucial to ensure proper insulation and heat distribution. A wide door lining helps to maintain temperature consistency and prevent heat loss. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a wide door lining specifically designed for underfloor heating systems.</p>
    
    <div class="materials">
        <h2>Materials Needed:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>MDF or solid wood boards (width depending on your door frame)</li>
            <li>Insulation board (suitable for underfloor heating)</li>
            <li>Adhesive (suitable for bonding wood and insulation)</li>
            <li>Wood screws</li>
            <li>Wood filler</li>
            <li>Sandpaper (various grits)</li>
            <li>Paint or varnish (as per your preference)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tools">
        <h2>Tools Required:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Measuring tape</li>
            <li>Circular saw or table saw</li>
            <li>Drill with screwdriver bits</li>
            <li>Jigsaw (for cutting out handle areas if necessary)</li>
            <li>Carpenter's square</li>
            <li>Pencil</li>
            <li>Safety glasses and dust mask</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Measure the door frame</h3>
        <p>Carefully measure the height and width of your door frame. Add an extra 2-3 cm to each measurement to ensure the lining will fit snugly.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Cut the MDF or wood boards</h3>
        <p>Using your circular saw or table saw, cut the MDF or wood boards to the measured dimensions. You'll need two vertical pieces for the sides and one horizontal piece for the top.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Cut the insulation board</h3>
        <p>Cut pieces of insulation board to fit the back of each MDF or wood board. The insulation should be slightly smaller than the wood to allow for a flush fit against the door frame.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Attach the insulation</h3>
        <p>Apply adhesive to the back of the MDF or wood boards and carefully attach the insulation. Press firmly and allow to dry according to the adhesive manufacturer's instructions.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Install the lining</h3>
        <p>Position the side pieces first, ensuring they're level and plumb. Secure them to the door frame using wood screws. Then, install the top piece, making sure it's level and flush with the side pieces.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Fill and sand</h3>
        <p>Use wood filler to cover any screw holes or gaps. Once dry, sand the entire lining smooth, starting with coarse-grit sandpaper and finishing with fine-grit for a polished look.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Paint or varnish</h3>
        <p>Apply your chosen finish to the lining. This could be paint to match your decor or a clear varnish to protect the wood while showcasing its natural grain.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
        <p>For added insulation, consider applying a thin strip of weather stripping around the edge of the door lining where it meets the door. This will help prevent drafts and maintain the efficiency of your underfloor heating system.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>By following these steps, you can create a wide door lining that not only looks great but also helps to maximize the efficiency of your underfloor heating system. Remember to always prioritize safety when working with power tools and to consult with a professional if you're unsure about any part of the process.</p>

    <h1>Air Conditioning System Basics: How Does It Work?</h1>
    
    <p>Air conditioning systems are designed to cool and dehumidify indoor air, providing comfort in hot and humid conditions. Let's explore the components and process of a typical air conditioning system.</p>

    <h2>Main Components</h2>

    <div class="component">
        <h3>1. Evaporator</h3>
        <p>The evaporator is located inside the building and contains cold, liquid refrigerant. It absorbs heat from the indoor air, causing the refrigerant to evaporate into a gas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="component">
        <h3>2. Compressor</h3>
        <p>The compressor is the heart of the system. It pressurizes the gaseous refrigerant, raising its temperature and preparing it for the condensation process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="component">
        <h3>3. Condenser</h3>
        <p>Located outside the building, the condenser releases the heat absorbed from indoors to the outside air. As the refrigerant cools, it condenses back into a liquid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="component">
        <h3>4. Expansion Valve</h3>
        <p>This valve reduces the pressure of the liquid refrigerant, causing it to expand and cool rapidly before re-entering the evaporator.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Cooling Process</h2>

    <div class="process">
        <h3>Step 1: Heat Absorption</h3>
        <p>Warm indoor air is drawn over the cold evaporator coils. The refrigerant inside the coils absorbs heat from the air and evaporates into a gas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
        <h3>Step 2: Compression</h3>
        <p>The gaseous refrigerant is compressed, increasing its temperature and pressure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
        <h3>Step 3: Heat Release</h3>
        <p>The hot, high-pressure refrigerant flows through the condenser. Outside air blows across the condenser coils, absorbing heat from the refrigerant and releasing it outdoors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
        <h3>Step 4: Expansion</h3>
        <p>The cooled liquid refrigerant passes through the expansion valve, where it expands and cools further.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
        <h3>Step 5: Cycle Repeats</h3>
        <p>The cool refrigerant returns to the evaporator, and the cycle begins again.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Additional Components</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Thermostat:</strong> Controls the system, turning it on and off to maintain the desired temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Blower:</strong> Circulates air through the system and into the building.</li>
        <li><strong>Air Filter:</strong> Removes dust and particles from the air before it enters the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Ductwork:</strong> Channels cooled air throughout the building.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Energy Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Modern air conditioning systems are designed to be energy-efficient. Factors that contribute to efficiency include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High-efficiency compressors</li>
        <li>Variable speed fans</li>
        <li>Improved coil design</li>
        <li>Better insulation</li>
        <li>Smart thermostats for optimal temperature control</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding how your air conditioning system works can help you maintain it properly and use it efficiently, ensuring comfort while minimizing energy consumption.</p>

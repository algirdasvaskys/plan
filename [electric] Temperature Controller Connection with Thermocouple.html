    <h1>Temperature Controller Connection with Thermocouple</h1>
    
    <p>This guide will walk you through the process of connecting a temperature controller with a thermocouple. Thermocouples are widely used in industrial settings for temperature measurement and control.</p>

    <h2>What You'll Need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Temperature controller</li>
        <li>Thermocouple</li>
        <li>Thermocouple wire</li>
        <li>Screwdriver</li>
        <li>Wire strippers</li>
        <li>Multimeter (for testing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Identify Your Thermocouple Type</h3>
        <p>Determine the type of thermocouple you're using (e.g., Type K, Type J, Type T). This information is crucial for proper connection and configuration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Locate the Thermocouple Input Terminals</h3>
        <p>Find the thermocouple input terminals on your temperature controller. They are usually labeled as TC+ and TC- or with the specific thermocouple type (e.g., K+ and K- for Type K).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Thermocouple Wire</h3>
        <p>Strip about 1/4 inch (6mm) of insulation from the ends of the thermocouple wire. Be careful not to damage the wire itself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Connect the Thermocouple to the Controller</h3>
        <p>Connect the positive (usually red) wire to the TC+ or + terminal, and the negative (usually blue or white) wire to the TC- or - terminal. Ensure the connections are tight and secure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Important Note on Polarity</h3>
        <p>Correct polarity is crucial for accurate temperature readings. Reversed polarity can cause significant measurement errors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Configure the Controller</h3>
        <p>Set up the controller to match your thermocouple type. This usually involves entering a setup menu and selecting the correct thermocouple type.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Test the Connection</h3>
        <p>Power on the controller and verify that it's reading a temperature. You can test the accuracy by comparing the reading to a known temperature source or another thermometer.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you're not getting a reading, double-check all connections.</li>
        <li>Ensure the controller is configured for the correct thermocouple type.</li>
        <li>Check for any breaks in the thermocouple wire.</li>
        <li>Verify that the thermocouple itself is functioning properly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Safety Considerations:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Always follow proper electrical safety procedures.</li>
        <li>Ensure the controller and any associated equipment are properly grounded.</li>
        <li>Be aware of the temperature limits of your thermocouple and controller.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following these steps, you should be able to successfully connect a temperature controller with a thermocouple. Remember, precise temperature control is crucial in many industrial processes, so take care to ensure accurate connections and proper configuration.</p>

    <p>For more detailed information or specific questions about electrical connections, consult with a qualified electrician or refer to the manufacturer's documentation for your specific controller and thermocouple models.</p>

    <h1>Making and Fitting Valley Rafters - The Big Build 30</h1>

    <p>Valley rafters are crucial components in complex roof structures, particularly where two roof planes intersect. This guide will walk you through the process of making and fitting valley rafters.</p>

    <h2>What are Valley Rafters?</h2>
    <p>Valley rafters run from the ridge board to the corner of the building, forming the valley where two roof planes meet. They support the jack rafters and help direct water off the roof.</p>

    <h2>Tools and Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tape measure</li>
        <li>Framing square</li>
        <li>Circular saw</li>
        <li>Pencil</li>
        <li>Level</li>
        <li>Hammer or nail gun</li>
        <li>Nails (appropriate for framing)</li>
        <li>Lumber (size depends on your specific roof design)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Measure and Mark</h3>
        <p>Measure the distance from the ridge board to the corner of the building where the valley will sit. This will be the length of your valley rafter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Determine the Angle</h3>
        <p>Use a framing square to determine the angle at which the valley rafter will meet the ridge board and the building corner. This angle is typically 45 degrees for equal-pitched roofs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Cut the Valley Rafter</h3>
        <p>Cut your lumber to the measured length, ensuring both ends are cut at the correct angles to fit snugly against the ridge board and building corner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Bird's Mouth Cut</h3>
        <p>Create a bird's mouth cut at the bottom end of the valley rafter. This notch allows the rafter to sit securely on the wall plate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Test Fit</h3>
        <p>Place the valley rafter in position to ensure it fits correctly. Make any necessary adjustments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Install the Valley Rafter</h3>
        <p>Once you're satisfied with the fit, nail the valley rafter securely into place at both the ridge board and the wall plate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Install Jack Rafters</h3>
        <p>Cut and install the jack rafters, which run from the valley rafter to the main rafters on each side.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Always double-check your measurements before cutting.</li>
        <li>Use a level to ensure your valley rafter is installed straight.</li>
        <li>Consider using metal valley rafter brackets for added strength.</li>
        <li>Ensure proper waterproofing in the valley area during roofing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Safety Considerations</h2>
    <p>Always wear appropriate safety gear, including safety glasses and gloves. When working at height, use proper fall protection equipment. If you're unsure about any aspect of the job, consult a professional.</p>

    <p>Remember, making and fitting valley rafters is a complex task that requires precision and experience. If you're not confident in your abilities, it's best to hire a professional carpenter or roofer.</p>

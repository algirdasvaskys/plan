    <h1>How to Build a Deck: Part 3</h1>
    <h2>Protect Your Deck Structure Using Deck Tape</h2>

    <p>Protecting your deck structure is crucial for its longevity and durability. One effective method is using deck tape. This guide will walk you through the process of applying deck tape to safeguard your deck's structural elements.</p>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Gather Materials</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Deck tape (butyl-based or acrylic)</li>
            <li>Measuring tape</li>
            <li>Utility knife</li>
            <li>Clean cloth</li>
            <li>Rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li>Roller (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Surface</h3>
        <p>Ensure all surfaces where you'll apply the tape are clean, dry, and free from dirt, dust, and debris. Use a clean cloth dampened with rubbing alcohol to wipe down the areas for better adhesion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Measure and Cut</h3>
        <p>Measure the length of the joists, beams, and ledger board where you'll apply the tape. Cut the deck tape to size using a utility knife, adding a few extra inches for overlap.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Apply to Joists</h3>
        <p>Start by applying the tape to the top of each joist:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel back a small portion of the tape's backing.</li>
            <li>Align the tape with the center of the joist's top edge.</li>
            <li>Press down firmly and slowly peel away the backing as you go.</li>
            <li>Use a roller (if available) to ensure good contact and remove air bubbles.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Protect the Ledger Board</h3>
        <p>Apply tape to the ledger board, which connects the deck to your house:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start at one end of the ledger board.</li>
            <li>Apply the tape horizontally, covering the entire top surface.</li>
            <li>Wrap the tape down the front face by about 2 inches.</li>
            <li>For wider ledger boards, use multiple strips with a 2-inch overlap.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Cover Beam Tops</h3>
        <p>Apply tape to the tops of support beams:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut tape to the width of the beam plus 1 inch on each side.</li>
            <li>Center the tape on the beam top and press down.</li>
            <li>Fold the excess down the sides of the beam.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Seal Butt Joints</h3>
        <p>For any butt joints between boards:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut a piece of tape about 6 inches long.</li>
            <li>Center it over the joint, with 3 inches on each board.</li>
            <li>Press down firmly to create a waterproof seal.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Check Your Work</h3>
        <p>After application, inspect all taped areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure there are no air bubbles or loose edges.</li>
            <li>Press down any loose sections.</li>
            <li>Add additional tape to any missed spots or potential weak points.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Tips for Success:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Work on a dry day with temperatures above 50°F (10°C) for best adhesion.</li>
        <li>If using wider tape, have a helper assist in keeping it straight during application.</li>
        <li>For maximum protection, consider applying tape to the sides of joists and beams as well.</li>
        <li>Some deck tapes are UV-resistant and can be left exposed, while others should be covered. Check your product specifications.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following these steps, you'll add an extra layer of protection to your deck's structure, helping to prevent water damage and extend the life of your deck. Remember, proper installation of deck tape is crucial for its effectiveness, so take your time and be thorough in your application.</p>

    <h1>Understanding Timers and Their Contacts</h1>

    <h2>What is a Timer?</h2>
    <p>A timer is an automatic control device that operates an electrical circuit for a pre-set time interval. It's used in various applications, from simple household appliances to complex industrial processes. Timers can be mechanical, electronic, or software-based, and they allow for precise timing of events or actions.</p>

    <h2>NO, NC, and Common in Timers</h2>
    <p>In the context of timers and electrical switches, NO, NC, and Common refer to different types of contacts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NO (Normally Open):</strong> This contact is open (not connected) when the timer is not activated. It closes (connects) when the timer is activated.</li>
        <li><strong>NC (Normally Closed):</strong> This contact is closed (connected) when the timer is not activated. It opens (disconnects) when the timer is activated.</li>
        <li><strong>Common:</strong> This is the shared terminal that connects to either the NO or NC contact, depending on the timer's state.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="timer-diagram">
        <div class="contact" id="no">NO</div>
        <div class="contact" id="nc">NC</div>
        <div class="contact" id="common">Common</div>
        <div class="wire" id="wire1"></div>
        <div class="wire" id="wire2"></div>
        <div class="wire" id="wire3"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>How Timers Work</h2>
    <p>Timers operate based on the following principles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Setting the Time:</strong> The user sets the desired time interval on the timer.</li>
        <li><strong>Activation:</strong> When the timer is started, it begins counting down the set time.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Switching:</strong> During operation, the timer switches its contacts:
            <ul>
                <li>The NO contact closes, allowing current to flow.</li>
                <li>The NC contact opens, interrupting current flow.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Time Expiration:</strong> When the set time elapses, the timer reverts its contacts to their original state.</li>
        <li><strong>Reset:</strong> The timer can be reset manually or automatically for the next cycle.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Applications of Timers</h2>
    <p>Timers are used in various applications, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Industrial process control</li>
        <li>Lighting control systems</li>
        <li>Heating and cooling systems</li>
        <li>Home appliances (e.g., ovens, washing machines)</li>
        <li>Traffic light control</li>
        <li>Security systems</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding the operation of timers and their contacts is crucial for anyone working with electrical systems or automation. Proper use of timers can lead to energy savings, improved safety, and more efficient processes in both industrial and domestic settings.</p>

    <h1>Digital Ammeter Voltmeter Connection with CT</h1>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Working with electrical systems can be dangerous. Always follow safety protocols and consult with a qualified electrician if you're unsure about any step in the process.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This guide will walk you through the process of connecting a digital ammeter and voltmeter using a Current Transformer (CT) in an electrical system. This setup is commonly used to measure both current and voltage in high-current applications.</p>
    
    <h2>Components Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Digital Ammeter</li>
        <li>Digital Voltmeter</li>
        <li>Current Transformer (CT)</li>
        <li>Burden Resistor</li>
        <li>Connecting wires</li>
        <li>Circuit breaker or fuse for protection</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Connection Process</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Safety First</h3>
        <p>Ensure that the power to the circuit is completely turned off before beginning any work. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Install the Current Transformer</h3>
        <p>Place the CT around the main power line that you want to measure. Ensure that only one conductor passes through the CT.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Connect the Burden Resistor</h3>
        <p>Connect the burden resistor across the secondary terminals of the CT. This resistor converts the current output of the CT into a voltage that can be measured.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Connect the Ammeter</h3>
        <p>Connect the ammeter in parallel with the burden resistor. This will allow it to measure the current flowing through the primary conductor.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Connect the Voltmeter</h3>
        <p>Connect the voltmeter across the line and neutral of the circuit you're measuring. Ensure proper voltage range selection on the voltmeter.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Install Protection</h3>
        <p>Install a circuit breaker or fuse in series with the voltmeter to protect it from overcurrent.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Double-Check Connections</h3>
        <p>Verify all connections are secure and correctly made before powering on the circuit.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Power On and Test</h3>
        <p>Turn on the power to the circuit and check that both the ammeter and voltmeter are reading expected values.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="note">
        <h3>Important Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Always use a CT with the appropriate current ratio for your application.</li>
            <li>Never open-circuit the secondary of a CT while current is flowing in the primary. This can cause dangerously high voltages.</li>
            <li>Ensure the burden resistor is properly sized for your CT and measurement range.</li>
            <li>Regular calibration of your measuring instruments is crucial for accurate readings.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By following these steps, you can safely and effectively connect a digital ammeter and voltmeter using a CT in your electrical system. Always prioritize safety and consult with a professional if you're unsure about any aspect of the installation or measurement process.</p>

    <h1>How to Turn ON & OFF One Bulb From 3 Places</h1>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Working with electrical wiring can be dangerous. If you're not confident in your abilities, please consult a licensed electrician.
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Controlling a single light bulb from three different locations requires a specific wiring configuration using two three-way switches and one four-way switch. This setup is often used in large rooms with multiple entrances or on staircases.</p>

    <h2>Components Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 light bulb and fixture</li>
        <li>2 three-way switches</li>
        <li>1 four-way switch</li>
        <li>Electrical wire (14/3 and 14/2 NM cable)</li>
        <li>Wire nuts</li>
        <li>Electrical tape</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wiring Diagram</h2>
    <div class="diagram">

    </div>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Turn Off Power</h3>
        <p>Before starting, turn off the power to the circuit at the main electrical panel. Verify that the power is off using a voltage tester.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Install the First Three-Way Switch</h3>
        <p>Connect the black (hot) wire from the power source to the common terminal of the first three-way switch. Connect two traveler wires to the other two terminals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Install the Four-Way Switch</h3>
        <p>Run the traveler wires from the first three-way switch to the four-way switch. Connect these to one side of the four-way switch. On the other side, connect two new traveler wires that will go to the second three-way switch.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Install the Second Three-Way Switch</h3>
        <p>Connect the traveler wires from the four-way switch to the two traveler terminals on the second three-way switch. The common terminal of this switch will connect to the light fixture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Connect the Light Fixture</h3>
        <p>Connect the wire from the common terminal of the second three-way switch to the black wire of the light fixture. Connect the white (neutral) wire from the power source to the white wire of the light fixture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Ground the Switches and Fixture</h3>
        <p>Connect all ground wires (bare copper or green) to each other and to the ground screws on the switches and light fixture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Test the Circuit</h3>
        <p>After ensuring all connections are secure and no bare wires are exposed, turn the power back on and test the switches. The light should turn on and off from all three locations.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>In this configuration, the three-way switches act as the main on/off controls, while the four-way switch in the middle changes the traveler wire connections. This allows any of the three switches to change the state of the light (on to off, or off to on) regardless of the position of the other switches.</p>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Remember:</strong> If you're unsure about any step in this process, it's always best to consult with or hire a professional electrician. Safety should always be your top priority when working with electrical systems.

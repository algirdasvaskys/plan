    <h1>Valley Jack Rafters: The Big Build 31</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Valley jack rafters are an essential component in roof framing, particularly in complex roof designs with intersecting roof planes. They run from the ridge board to the valley rafter, providing support for the roof sheathing and helping to distribute the load.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lumber (size depends on your specific build)</li>
            <li>Framing square</li>
            <li>Circular saw</li>
            <li>Tape measure</li>
            <li>Pencil</li>
            <li>Level</li>
            <li>Framing nailer or hammer</li>
            <li>Nails (16d for most applications)</li>
            <li>Safety equipment (goggles, gloves, hard hat)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Step-by-Step Method</h2>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 1: Measure and Mark</h3>
            <p>Measure the distance from the ridge board to the valley rafter. This will be the length of your valley jack rafter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 2: Determine the Angles</h3>
            <p>Use a framing square to determine the plumb cut (vertical) and seat cut (horizontal) angles. The plumb cut will match the roof pitch, while the seat cut will be perpendicular to the plumb cut.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 3: Cut the Rafter</h3>
            <p>Mark your lumber with the measured length and angles. Use a circular saw to make the plumb cut at the top and the seat cut at the bottom of the rafter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 4: Test Fit</h3>
            <p>Place the cut rafter in position to ensure it fits correctly between the ridge board and valley rafter. Make any necessary adjustments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 5: Install the Rafter</h3>
            <p>Once you're satisfied with the fit, nail the valley jack rafter into place. Secure it to both the ridge board and the valley rafter using framing nails.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 6: Repeat</h3>
            <p>Continue this process for all required valley jack rafters, spacing them according to your building plans (typically 16" or 24" on center).</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Important Considerations</h2>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Valley jack rafters decrease in length as they get further from the ridge. You'll need to measure and cut each one individually.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Safety:</strong> Always wear appropriate safety gear and follow local building codes and regulations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Precision:</strong> Accurate measurements and cuts are crucial for a properly functioning roof structure. Double-check your work at each step.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Installing valley jack rafters is a crucial part of "The Big Build 31" process. With careful measurement, cutting, and installation, you can create a strong and reliable roof structure that will stand the test of time.</p>

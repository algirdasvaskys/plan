    <h1>The Big Build 16: Bolting Wall Plates to Steel and Joist Arrival</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Bolting Wall Plates to Steel</h2>
        <p>Bolting wall plates to steel is a crucial step in construction. It provides a secure foundation for the walls and ensures structural integrity. Here's the method:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare the steel beam surface</li>
            <li>Position the wall plate</li>
            <li>Mark bolt hole locations</li>
            <li>Drill holes in the steel beam</li>
            <li>Install appropriate bolts</li>
            <li>Tighten the bolts to specifications</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Always follow local building codes and consult with a structural engineer when bolting wall plates to steel.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Detailed Method for Bolting Wall Plates to Steel</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the steel beam surface:</strong> Clean the surface of the steel beam to remove any dirt, rust, or debris. This ensures proper contact between the steel and the wall plate.</li>
            <li><strong>Position the wall plate:</strong> Place the wooden wall plate on top of the steel beam in its final position. Ensure it's level and aligned correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Mark bolt hole locations:</strong> Use a pencil or marker to indicate where the bolt holes will be drilled. Space them evenly and according to your structural plans.</li>
            <li><strong>Drill holes in the steel beam:</strong> Use a drill with a metal bit to create holes in the steel beam at the marked locations. The hole size should match the bolt diameter.</li>
            <li><strong>Install appropriate bolts:</strong> Choose bolts that are suitable for connecting wood to steel. Common options include carriage bolts or hex bolts with washers and nuts.</li>
            <li><strong>Tighten the bolts:</strong> Use a wrench or socket to tighten the bolts securely. Be careful not to over-tighten, which could damage the wood or strip the threads.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Joist Arrival</h2>
        <p>The arrival of joists is an exciting milestone in the construction process. Here's what to do when your joists arrive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inspect the joists for damage</li>
            <li>Count and verify the order</li>
            <li>Store the joists properly</li>
            <li>Prepare for installation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Handling and Storing Joists</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> Carefully examine each joist for any signs of damage, warping, or defects.</li>
            <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Count the joists and check against your order to ensure you've received the correct quantity and sizes.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store joists on a flat, dry surface. Use spacers to allow air circulation and prevent moisture buildup.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection:</strong> If storing outdoors, cover the joists with a waterproof tarp to protect them from the elements.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Proper storage of joists is crucial to maintain their structural integrity and prevent warping or damage before installation.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Preparing for Joist Installation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Review your construction plans</li>
            <li>Ensure all necessary tools are available</li>
            <li>Check that the supporting structure is ready for joist installation</li>
            <li>Mark joist positions on the supporting beams or wall plates</li>
            <li>Have safety equipment ready, including hard hats and work gloves</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Bolting wall plates to steel and the arrival of joists are significant steps in the construction process. Proper execution of these tasks ensures a strong, stable structure. Always prioritize safety and follow local building regulations throughout the construction process.</p>

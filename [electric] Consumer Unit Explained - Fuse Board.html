    <h1>Consumer Unit Explained - Fuse Board</h1>

    <h2>What is a Consumer Unit?</h2>
    <p>A consumer unit, also known as a fuse board, distribution board, or breaker panel, is a crucial component of a building's electrical system. It distributes electricity from the main supply to various circuits throughout the property.</p>

    <h2>Components of a Consumer Unit</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Main Switch:</strong> Controls the power supply to the entire consumer unit.</li>
        <li><strong>RCD (Residual Current Device):</strong> Protects against electric shocks and electrical fires.</li>
        <li><strong>MCBs (Miniature Circuit Breakers):</strong> Protect individual circuits from overloads and short circuits.</li>
        <li><strong>RCBOs (Residual Current Breaker with Overload):</strong> Combine the functions of RCDs and MCBs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How a Consumer Unit Works</h2>
    <p>The consumer unit receives electricity from the main supply and distributes it to various circuits in the property. Each circuit is protected by either an MCB or RCBO. If there's an issue like an overload or short circuit, these devices trip, cutting off the power to that specific circuit.</p>

    <div class="important">
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Always consult a qualified electrician for any work on your consumer unit. Incorrect handling can be extremely dangerous.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Maintenance and Safety</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Regularly test RCDs using the test button.</li>
        <li>Keep the area around the consumer unit clear and accessible.</li>
        <li>Never tamper with or modify the consumer unit yourself.</li>
        <li>If a circuit keeps tripping, consult a professional electrician.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Upgrading Your Consumer Unit</h2>
    <p>Consider upgrading your consumer unit if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's over 25 years old</li>
        <li>You're experiencing frequent tripping</li>
        <li>You're adding significant new electrical loads to your property</li>
        <li>Your current unit doesn't have RCD protection</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember, electrical work should always be carried out by a certified electrician to ensure safety and compliance with local regulations.</p>

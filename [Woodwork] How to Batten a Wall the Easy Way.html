    <div class="materials">
        <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard) strips or wooden battens</li>
            <li>Measuring tape</li>
            <li>Pencil</li>
            <li>Level</li>
            <li>Miter saw or hand saw</li>
            <li>Nail gun or hammer and finishing nails</li>
            <li>Wood filler</li>
            <li>Sandpaper</li>
            <li>Paint or wood stain</li>
            <li>Paintbrush or roller</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="steps">
        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Plan your design:</strong> Decide on the pattern you want to create with the battens. Common designs include grid patterns, vertical stripes, or more complex geometric shapes.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Prepare the wall:</strong> Clean the wall surface and repair any damages. If you're painting, it's easier to paint the wall before adding battens.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Measure and mark:</strong> Use a measuring tape and level to mark where your battens will go. Ensure your lines are straight and evenly spaced.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Cut the battens:</strong> Measure and cut your MDF strips or wooden battens to the required lengths using a miter saw or hand saw. For corners or intersections, cut the ends at a 45-degree angle for a clean join.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Attach the battens:</strong> Starting from one corner of the wall, use a nail gun or hammer and finishing nails to attach the battens to the wall. Make sure they're level as you go.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Fill nail holes:</strong> Use wood filler to cover the nail holes and any gaps between the battens and the wall.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Sand:</strong> Once the wood filler is dry, sand the battens and filled areas to create a smooth surface.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Paint or stain:</strong> Apply your chosen paint or wood stain to the battens and touch up the wall if necessary. You may need to apply multiple coats for an even finish.</li>
        </ol>

    <div class="tips">
        <h2>Helpful Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For a cohesive look, paint the battens the same color as the wall.</li>
            <li>Use a stud finder to locate wall studs for more secure attachment of the battens.</li>
            <li>If you're new to this, start with a simple design and work your way up to more complex patterns.</li>
            <li>Pre-paint your battens before installation to save time, then touch up after installation.</li>
            <li>For a more traditional look, use wooden battens instead of MDF.</li>
            <li>Always measure twice and cut once to avoid wasting materials.</li>
        </ul>

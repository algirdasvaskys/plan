    <h1>DC Parallel Circuits Explained</h1>
    
    <h2>What is a Parallel Circuit?</h2>
    <p>A parallel circuit is an electrical circuit where the components are connected across each other, forming multiple paths for current to flow. In a parallel circuit, each component has its own branch, and the same voltage is applied across all branches.</p>

    <h2>Basic Principles of Parallel Circuits</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Voltage:</strong> The voltage across each component in a parallel circuit is the same as the source voltage.</li>
        <li><strong>Current:</strong> The total current in a parallel circuit is the sum of the currents through each branch.</li>
        <li><strong>Resistance:</strong> The total resistance in a parallel circuit is always less than the smallest individual resistance.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Working Principle of Parallel Circuits</h2>
    <p>In a parallel circuit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Current divides among the branches based on the resistance of each branch.</li>
        <li>Each component receives the full circuit voltage.</li>
        <li>If one branch is disconnected or fails, the other branches continue to operate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Calculating Total Resistance in Parallel</h2>
    <p>The formula for calculating the total resistance in a parallel circuit is:</p>
    <div class="formula">
        1/R<sub>total</sub> = 1/R<sub>1</sub> + 1/R<sub>2</sub> + 1/R<sub>3</sub> + ...
    </div>
    <p>Where R<sub>total</sub> is the total resistance and R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, etc., are the individual resistances.</p>

    <h2>Calculating Total Current in Parallel</h2>
    <p>The total current in a parallel circuit is the sum of the currents in each branch:</p>
    <div class="formula">
        I<sub>total</sub> = I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>3</sub> + ...
    </div>
    <p>Where I<sub>total</sub> is the total current and I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>, etc., are the currents in each branch.</p>

    <h2>Advantages of Parallel Circuits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each component receives the full voltage.</li>
        <li>Failure of one component doesn't affect others.</li>
        <li>Easy to add more components without significantly affecting the circuit.</li>
        <li>Used in household wiring to allow independent operation of appliances.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications of Parallel Circuits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Home electrical systems</li>
        <li>Automotive electrical systems</li>
        <li>Power distribution in buildings</li>
        <li>Computer power supplies</li>
        <li>Battery banks in solar power systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Understanding parallel circuits is crucial for anyone working with electrical systems. They offer advantages in terms of reliability and flexibility, making them essential in many applications. By grasping the basic principles and calculations involved, you can effectively design and troubleshoot parallel circuits in various settings.</p>

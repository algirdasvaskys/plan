    <h1>Measuring HACK (Hip Angle Correction Kit)</h1>
    
    <p>The Hip Angle Correction Kit (HACK) is a measurement used in orthopedics and biomechanics to assess and correct hip joint angles. This guide will walk you through the process of measuring HACK accurately.</p>
    
    <h2>Equipment Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Goniometer</li>
        <li>Marking pen</li>
        <li>Flat, firm surface</li>
        <li>Assistant (recommended)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Measurement Process:</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Patient Positioning</h3>
        <p>Have the patient lie supine (on their back) on a flat, firm surface. Ensure their legs are straight and relaxed.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Identify Anatomical Landmarks</h3>
        <p>Locate and mark the following points with a marking pen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anterior Superior Iliac Spine (ASIS)</li>
            <li>Center of the hip joint (approximately 2cm below the midpoint of the inguinal ligament)</li>
            <li>Lateral epicondyle of the femur</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Measure Resting Hip Angle</h3>
        <p>Using the goniometer:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Align the stationary arm with a line from the ASIS to the center of the hip joint.</li>
            <li>Align the movable arm with the lateral midline of the femur, using the greater trochanter and lateral epicondyle as reference points.</li>
            <li>Record the angle shown on the goniometer. This is the resting hip angle.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Apply HACK</h3>
        <p>Apply the Hip Angle Correction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. This usually involves placing wedges or supports under specific areas of the pelvis or thigh.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Measure Corrected Hip Angle</h3>
        <p>Repeat the measurement process from Step 3 with the HACK in place. Record this new angle as the corrected hip angle.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Calculate HACK Measurement</h3>
        <p>The HACK measurement is the difference between the corrected hip angle and the resting hip angle:</p>
        <p><strong>HACK = Corrected Hip Angle - Resting Hip Angle</strong></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="note">
        <h3>Important Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure consistent patient positioning throughout the measurement process.</li>
            <li>Take multiple measurements and use the average for increased accuracy.</li>
            <li>Always follow proper hygiene and safety protocols when working with patients.</li>
            <li>The HACK measurement should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare professional in the context of the patient's overall clinical picture.</li>
        </ul>

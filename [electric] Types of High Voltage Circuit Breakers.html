    <h1>Types of High Voltage Circuit Breakers</h1>
    
    <p>High voltage circuit breakers are crucial components in power systems, grids, and substations. They are designed to interrupt fault currents and isolate faulty sections of the power system. Here are the main types of high voltage circuit breakers:</p>

    <div class="breaker-type">
        <h2>1. Oil Circuit Breakers</h2>
        <h3>Types:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bulk Oil Circuit Breakers</li>
            <li>Minimum Oil Circuit Breakers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Oil circuit breakers use oil as an arc-quenching medium. When a fault occurs, the arc is formed underwater, and the heat of the arc vaporizes the surrounding oil. This creates a high-pressure oil vapor that helps extinguish the arc.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="breaker-type">
        <h2>2. Air Blast Circuit Breakers</h2>
        <p>These breakers use a blast of compressed air to extinguish the arc. When a fault occurs, a high-pressure air blast is directed across the arc, cooling it and blowing it out. Air blast circuit breakers are suitable for high voltage applications.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="breaker-type">
        <h2>3. Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) Circuit Breakers</h2>
        <p>SF6 circuit breakers use sulfur hexafluoride gas as the arc-quenching medium. SF6 has excellent insulating and arc-quenching properties. These breakers are widely used in high voltage and extra-high voltage applications due to their superior performance and compact size.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="breaker-type">
        <h2>4. Vacuum Circuit Breakers</h2>
        <p>Vacuum circuit breakers interrupt the current by separating contacts in a high vacuum. The vacuum provides excellent insulation and quickly extinguishes the arc. These breakers are commonly used in medium voltage applications and are known for their reliability and long service life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="breaker-type">
        <h2>5. Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS)</h2>
        <p>GIS is a compact assembly that combines various high voltage components, including circuit breakers, in a gas-insulated metal enclosure. The insulating gas is typically SF6. GIS is used in substations where space is limited or in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
    </div>

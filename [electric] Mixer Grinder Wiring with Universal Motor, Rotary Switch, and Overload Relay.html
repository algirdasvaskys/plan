    <h1>Mixer Grinder Wiring with Universal Motor, Rotary Switch, and Overload Relay</h1>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Working with electrical equipment can be dangerous. Always ensure the power is disconnected before working on any electrical device. If you're not confident in your abilities, please consult a qualified electrician.
    </div>

    <h2>Components Required</h2>
    <div class="component">
        <ul>
            <li>Universal Motor</li>
            <li>Rotary Switch (3-speed)</li>
            <li>Overload Relay</li>
            <li>Power Cord</li>
            <li>Wires (appropriate gauge)</li>
            <li>Mixer Grinder Body</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Wiring Method</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <div class="step">
            Identify the components of the universal motor: There are typically four terminals - two for the field winding and two for the armature winding.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            Connect the power cord: The live wire (usually brown or red) goes to the rotary switch, and the neutral wire (usually blue or black) connects to one terminal of the field winding.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            Wire the rotary switch: This switch will control the speed of the motor. Connect the live wire from the power cord to the common terminal of the switch.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            Connect the switch to the motor: From the three speed terminals of the rotary switch, run wires to the field winding of the motor. These connections determine the motor speed.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            Wire the overload relay: Connect one terminal of the overload relay to the other terminal of the field winding. The other terminal of the relay connects to one terminal of the armature winding.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            Complete the motor circuit: Connect the remaining terminal of the armature winding to the neutral wire from the power cord.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            Ground connection: Ensure that the mixer grinder body is properly grounded. Connect the ground wire (usually green or yellow-green) from the power cord to a suitable grounding point on the mixer body.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            Double-check all connections: Ensure all connections are tight and properly insulated.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            Test the wiring: Once everything is securely in place, plug in the mixer grinder and test each speed setting to ensure proper operation.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The overload relay protects the motor from overheating due to excessive current draw. It will cut off power to the motor if it detects an overload condition.</li>
        <li>The rotary switch allows for different speed settings by connecting different portions of the field winding.</li>
        <li>Always use the appropriate wire gauge for the current rating of your mixer grinder.</li>
        <li>Ensure all connections are properly insulated to prevent short circuits.</li>
        <li>If you're unsure about any step, consult the manufacturer's manual or a professional electrician.</li>
    </ul>

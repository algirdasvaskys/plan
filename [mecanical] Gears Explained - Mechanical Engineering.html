    <h1>Gears Explained - Mechanical Engineering</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Gears are mechanical components with teeth that mesh with other gears to transmit rotational motion and force from one shaft to another. They are crucial in many machines and mechanical systems, allowing for changes in speed, torque, and direction of power transmission.</p>

    <h2>Basic Principles</h2>
    <p>Gears work on the principle of the wheel and axle, which is one of the six simple machines. When two gears mesh, the teeth of one gear push against the teeth of the other, causing both to rotate. The ratio of the number of teeth between two meshing gears determines the gear ratio, which affects the relative speed and torque between the input and output shafts.</p>

    <h2>Types of Gears</h2>

    <div class="gear-type">
        <h3>1. Spur Gears</h3>
        <p>Spur gears are the simplest type of gear, with straight teeth parallel to the axis of rotation. They are used for transmitting motion between parallel shafts and are common in many applications due to their simplicity and efficiency.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="gear-type">
        <h3>2. Helical Gears</h3>
        <p>Helical gears have teeth that are set at an angle to the axis of rotation. This angled design allows for smoother and quieter operation compared to spur gears, making them ideal for high-speed applications.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="gear-type">
        <h3>3. Bevel Gears</h3>
        <p>Bevel gears have conical-shaped teeth and are used to transmit motion between shafts that intersect at an angle, typically 90 degrees. They are common in differential drives of automobiles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="gear-type">
        <h3>4. Worm Gears</h3>
        <p>Worm gears consist of a worm (a screw-like gear) meshing with a worm wheel. They can achieve high reduction ratios and are self-locking, making them useful in applications where reverse motion prevention is needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="gear-type">
        <h3>5. Rack and Pinion</h3>
        <p>A rack and pinion system consists of a circular gear (pinion) meshing with a linear gear (rack). This arrangement converts rotational motion to linear motion or vice versa and is commonly used in steering systems.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Gear Ratios and Mechanical Advantage</h2>
    <p>The gear ratio is determined by the number of teeth on each gear. For example, if a driving gear has 10 teeth and the driven gear has 30 teeth, the gear ratio is 1:3. This means the driven gear will rotate once for every three rotations of the driving gear.</p>
    <p>Gear ratios provide mechanical advantage. In the example above, the driven gear will rotate slower but with three times the torque of the driving gear. This principle is used to create speed reducers or speed increasers in various machines.</p>

    <h2>Applications of Gears</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Automobiles (transmission, differential)</li>
        <li>Industrial machinery</li>
        <li>Clocks and watches</li>
        <li>Robotics</li>
        <li>Wind turbines</li>
        <li>Bicycles</li>
        <li>Elevators</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gears are fundamental components in mechanical engineering, enabling the precise control of speed, torque, and direction in a wide range of applications. Understanding gear types, ratios, and principles is crucial for designing efficient and effective mechanical systems.</p>

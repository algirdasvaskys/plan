    <h1>Lining a Velux Window with Insulation and Plasterboard</h1>
    
    <p>This guide will walk you through the process of lining a Velux window with insulation and plasterboard to improve energy efficiency and create a finished look.</p>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <h2>Safety First</h2>
        <p>Always prioritize safety when working on home improvement projects. Wear appropriate protective gear, including safety glasses, gloves, and a dust mask. Use caution when working at heights and ensure your ladder is stable.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Materials Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Insulation (rigid foam board or mineral wool)</li>
        <li>Plasterboard</li>
        <li>Wooden battens</li>
        <li>Screws and nails</li>
        <li>Vapor barrier</li>
        <li>Tape measure</li>
        <li>Utility knife</li>
        <li>Saw</li>
        <li>Screwdriver or drill</li>
        <li>Joint compound</li>
        <li>Sandpaper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Measure and Prepare</h3>
        <p>Measure the dimensions of your Velux window opening. Add an extra inch to these measurements to ensure proper coverage. Cut wooden battens to fit around the window frame.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Install Wooden Battens</h3>
        <p>Attach the wooden battens around the window frame using screws or nails. These will serve as a support structure for the insulation and plasterboard.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Apply Insulation</h3>
        <p>Cut the insulation material to fit between the battens. If using rigid foam board, you may need to score and snap it to size. For mineral wool, wear gloves and cut it slightly larger than the space for a snug fit. Insert the insulation between the battens.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Install Vapor Barrier</h3>
        <p>Cover the insulation with a vapor barrier, stapling it to the wooden battens. This helps prevent moisture from penetrating the insulation. Ensure all seams are sealed with appropriate tape.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Cut and Install Plasterboard</h3>
        <p>Measure and cut the plasterboard to fit over the insulated area. Secure the plasterboard to the wooden battens using drywall screws. Ensure the screws are countersunk slightly below the surface of the plasterboard.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Tape and Joint</h3>
        <p>Apply drywall tape to the seams between plasterboard sheets. Cover the tape and screw heads with joint compound using a putty knife. Allow it to dry completely.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Sand and Finish</h3>
        <p>Once the joint compound is dry, sand the surface smooth. Apply additional coats of joint compound if necessary, sanding between each coat. Once you achieve a smooth finish, the surface is ready for painting.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <h2>Important Notes:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure you maintain proper clearance around the Velux window for operation and ventilation.</li>
            <li>Check local building codes to ensure your project complies with regulations.</li>
            <li>If you're unsure about any part of the process, consider consulting a professional.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>By following these steps, you can successfully line your Velux window with insulation and plasterboard, improving your home's energy efficiency and interior aesthetics.</p>

    <h1>Making Window Reveal Strips in Cladding Series</h1>
    
    <p>Window reveal strips are an essential component in the cladding series, providing a clean finish and weather protection around window openings. This guide will walk you through the process of making and installing these strips.</p>
    
    <h2>Materials Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Aluminum or PVC strips</li>
        <li>Measuring tape</li>
        <li>Pencil or marker</li>
        <li>Tin snips or a fine-toothed saw</li>
        <li>File or sandpaper</li>
        <li>Sealant</li>
        <li>Screws or nails</li>
        <li>Drill or hammer</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Process:</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Measure the Window Opening</h3>
        <p>Carefully measure the height and width of the window opening. Add an extra 50mm to each measurement to allow for overlap and cutting adjustments.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Cut the Reveal Strips</h3>
        <p>Using your measurements, mark and cut the reveal strips to size. For the vertical strips, cut two pieces to the height measurement. For the horizontal strips, cut two pieces to the width measurement.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Miter the Corners</h3>
        <p>To create neat corners, miter the ends of the strips at a 45-degree angle. This will allow them to fit together seamlessly at the corners of the window.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: File the Edges</h3>
        <p>Use a file or sandpaper to smooth any rough edges on the cut strips. This will ensure a clean finish and prevent any potential injuries during handling.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Apply Sealant</h3>
        <p>Apply a bead of weatherproof sealant along the back edge of each strip. This will create a watertight seal when the strips are installed.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Install the Strips</h3>
        <p>Start with the bottom horizontal strip, then install the vertical strips, and finish with the top horizontal strip. Secure each strip in place using screws or nails, ensuring they are level and properly aligned.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Seal the Joints</h3>
        <p>Apply additional sealant to the joints where the strips meet, as well as around the edges where the strips meet the window frame and the cladding.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="note">
        <h3>Note:</h3>
        <p>Always ensure that the reveal strips are compatible with your cladding system and follow any specific manufacturer guidelines. Proper installation is crucial for effective weather protection and aesthetic appeal.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By following these steps, you can create and install window reveal strips that will enhance the appearance of your cladding while providing essential protection against the elements. Remember to take accurate measurements and work carefully for the best results.</p>

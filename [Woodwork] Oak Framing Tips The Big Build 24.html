    <h1>Oak Framing Tips: The Big Build 24</h1>

    <h2>1. Preparing Your Oak</h2>
    <p>Before you begin framing, ensure your oak is properly prepared:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use air-dried oak with a moisture content of 20-30%</li>
        <li>Allow for shrinkage in your designs, especially for wider timbers</li>
        <li>Check for any twists or bows in the timber and plan accordingly</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Fitting Staddle Stones</h2>
    <p>Staddle stones are traditional supports used to elevate timber frames off the ground. Here's how to fit them:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare a level foundation for each staddle stone</li>
        <li>Place the staddle stones at the corners and key points of your frame</li>
        <li>Use a laser level to ensure all stones are at the same height</li>
        <li>Secure the oak posts to the staddle stones using metal brackets or traditional joinery methods</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Always check local building regulations regarding the use of staddle stones, as modern building codes may require additional foundation work.
    </div>

    <h2>3. Drilling for Pegs</h2>
    <p>Wooden pegs are crucial in traditional oak framing. Follow these steps for drilling:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mark your drill points carefully, ensuring they align with your joinery plan</li>
        <li>Use a drill bit slightly smaller than your peg diameter (usually 1/16" smaller)</li>
        <li>Drill slowly and steadily to avoid splintering the exit point</li>
        <li>Clean out any debris from the holes before inserting pegs</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Always wear safety goggles and use sharp, high-quality drill bits to prevent injury and ensure clean holes.
    </div>

    <h2>4. Choosing and Preparing Pegs</h2>
    <p>The right pegs are essential for strong joints:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use hardwood pegs, preferably oak or ash</li>
        <li>Ensure pegs are straight-grained and free from knots</li>
        <li>Taper the ends of the pegs slightly to ease insertion</li>
        <li>Consider using octagonal pegs for a traditional look and better grip</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Assembling the Frame</h2>
    <p>When putting your frame together:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dry-fit all joints before final assembly</li>
        <li>Use draw-boring techniques for tighter joints</li>
        <li>Apply a small amount of glue in peg holes for added strength</li>
        <li>Drive pegs in firmly, but avoid over-hammering</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Finishing Touches</h2>
    <p>To complete your oak frame:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trim excess peg length, leaving about 1/4" proud of the surface</li>
        <li>Sand any rough areas, but maintain the natural character of the oak</li>
        <li>Apply a suitable finish to protect the wood, if desired</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Final Tip:</strong> Remember that oak framing is a skilled craft. If you're new to this, consider taking a course or working alongside an experienced framer for your first project.

    <h1>Glazing Gable Windows: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    
    <p>Glazing gable windows is an important process that ensures proper insulation and weatherproofing for your home. This guide will walk you through the steps to successfully glaze a gable window.</p>
    
    <h2>Materials Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Glazing compound</li>
        <li>Putty knife</li>
        <li>Glass cleaner</li>
        <li>Soft cloth</li>
        <li>Linseed oil (optional)</li>
        <li>Primer</li>
        <li>Paint</li>
        <li>Paintbrush</li>
        <li>Safety glasses</li>
        <li>Work gloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Process:</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Window</h3>
        <p>Clean the window frame thoroughly, removing any old glazing compound, dirt, or debris. Use a putty knife to scrape away old glazing. Clean the glass with glass cleaner and a soft cloth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Apply Linseed Oil (Optional)</h3>
        <p>If the wood frame is dry, apply a thin coat of linseed oil to help preserve the wood and improve adhesion of the glazing compound.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Apply the Glazing Compound</h3>
        <p>Using your putty knife, apply a thin, even layer of glazing compound around the edge of the glass where it meets the frame. Ensure there are no gaps or air pockets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Smooth the Glazing</h3>
        <p>Use your putty knife to smooth the glazing compound at a 45-degree angle. This creates a neat, professional finish and helps water run off the window.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Allow to Dry</h3>
        <p>Let the glazing compound dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. This usually takes several days.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Prime and Paint</h3>
        <p>Once the glazing is dry, apply a coat of primer over the glazing compound and the surrounding frame. After the primer dries, paint the frame and glazing to match your window trim.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Tip:</h3>
        <p>Work on a warm, dry day for best results. The glazing compound will be easier to work with and will dry more effectively.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Warning:</h3>
        <p>Always wear safety glasses and work gloves when glazing windows to protect yourself from glass shards and chemicals in the glazing compound.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Glazing gable windows is a straightforward process that can significantly improve the energy efficiency and appearance of your home. With the right tools and a bit of patience, you can achieve professional-looking results.</p>

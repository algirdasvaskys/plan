    <div class="important">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Working with electrical systems can be dangerous. Always consult a licensed electrician for installations or repairs.

        <h2>What is a GFCI?</h2>
        <p>A Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) is a safety device designed to protect people from electric shock. It quickly detects imbalances in electrical current and shuts off power to prevent potentially dangerous situations.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>How does a GFCI work?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Current Monitoring:</strong> The GFCI constantly monitors the current flowing through the hot (black) and neutral (white) wires of an electrical circuit.</li>
            <li><strong>Imbalance Detection:</strong> In a normal situation, the current flowing through these wires should be equal. If there's a difference of more than 4-6 milliamps, it indicates a ground fault.</li>
            <li><strong>Quick Response:</strong> When an imbalance is detected, the GFCI trips within a fraction of a second (about 1/40th of a second), cutting off the power supply.</li>
            <li><strong>Circuit Breaking:</strong> This rapid response prevents prolonged exposure to dangerous current levels that could cause electrocution.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Common Causes of Ground Faults</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Water coming into contact with electrical devices</li>
            <li>Damaged insulation on wires</li>
            <li>Faulty appliances or tools</li>
            <li>Improper wiring</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Where are GFCIs required?</h2>
        <p>GFCIs are typically required in areas where water and electricity may come into close contact, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bathrooms</li>
            <li>Kitchens</li>
            <li>Garages</li>
            <li>Outdoor areas</li>
            <li>Laundry rooms</li>
            <li>Basements</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Types of GFCI Protection</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>GFCI Outlets:</strong> Individual outlets with built-in GFCI protection.</li>
            <li><strong>GFCI Circuit Breakers:</strong> Protect entire circuits from the main electrical panel.</li>
            <li><strong>Portable GFCI Devices:</strong> Can be plugged into standard outlets to provide temporary GFCI protection.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Testing and Maintenance</h2>
        <p>To ensure proper function, GFCIs should be tested monthly:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Press the "Test" button on the GFCI outlet or breaker.</li>
            <li>The "Reset" button should pop out, indicating the GFCI has tripped.</li>
            <li>Press the "Reset" button to restore power.</li>
            <li>If the GFCI doesn't trip or reset, it may be faulty and should be replaced by a professional.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>GFCI breakers and outlets are crucial safety devices in modern electrical systems. They provide an additional layer of protection against electric shock and potential electrocution. Understanding how they work and ensuring they are properly installed and maintained is essential for home and workplace safety.</p>

    <h2>Tools and Materials Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Electrical socket</li>
        <li>Pattress box</li>
        <li>Cable (2.5mmÂ² twin and earth)</li>
        <li>Circuit breaker</li>
        <li>Screwdriver</li>
        <li>Wire strippers</li>
        <li>Voltage tester</li>
        <li>Drill with appropriate bits</li>
        <li>Hammer and chisel</li>
        <li>Fish tape or wire coat hanger</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Turn off the power:</strong> Locate your fuse box and turn off the power to the circuit you'll be working on. Use a voltage tester to ensure the power is off.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Choose the location:</strong> Decide where you want to place the new socket. Mark the outline of the pattress box on the wall.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Cut the hole:</strong> Use a drill to make holes at the corners of your outline. Then, use a hammer and chisel to carefully remove the plaster and create a hole for the pattress box.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Run the cable:</strong> Fish the cable from the nearest existing socket or junction box to your new socket location. You may need to lift floorboards or drill holes to route the cable.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Install the pattress box:</strong> Push the pattress box into the hole you've created. Secure it in place according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Connect the wires:</strong> Strip the ends of the wires and connect them to the new socket:
            <ul>
                <li>Brown wire (Live) to the terminal marked 'L'</li>
                <li>Blue wire (Neutral) to the terminal marked 'N'</li>
                <li>Green/Yellow wire (Earth) to the terminal marked with the earth symbol</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Attach the socket:</strong> Screw the socket onto the pattress box.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Test the circuit:</strong> Turn the power back on and use a voltage tester to check if the new socket is working correctly.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Tidy up:</strong> Fill any holes or gaps with appropriate filler and paint over if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Safety Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Always double-check that the power is off before starting work.</li>
        <li>Use proper insulated tools to avoid electric shock.</li>
        <li>Follow local building codes and regulations.</li>
        <li>If you encounter any unexpected issues or are unsure about any step, stop and consult a professional electrician.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Remember, if you're not confident in your ability to safely complete this task, it's always best to hire a qualified electrician. Electrical work can be dangerous if not done correctly, and improper installation can lead to fire hazards or electric shocks.</p>

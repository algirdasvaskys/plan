    <h1>Calculating Brick Quantity in a Wall</h1>
    
    <p>Determining the number of bricks required for a wall is an essential step in construction planning. This document outlines both practical and theoretical methods for calculating brick quantity.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Theoretical Method</h2>
    <div class="method">
        <p>The theoretical method involves using mathematical calculations based on the dimensions of the wall and the bricks.</p>
        
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine the wall dimensions (length, height, and thickness).</li>
            <li>Calculate the wall area.</li>
            <li>Determine the size of a single brick (including mortar joints).</li>
            <li>Calculate the area covered by one brick.</li>
            <li>Divide the wall area by the area of one brick.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Formula:</h3>
        <div class="formula">
            Number of Bricks = (Wall Length × Wall Height) ÷ (Brick Length × Brick Height)
        </div>
        
        <p>Note: This formula assumes a single-wythe wall. For multi-wythe walls, multiply the result by the number of wythes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>2. Practical Method</h2>
    <div class="method">
        <p>The practical method takes into account real-world factors and typically involves using established rules of thumb or empirical data.</p>
        
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Calculate the wall area in square feet or square meters.</li>
            <li>Use a brick count factor based on common brick sizes and layouts.</li>
            <li>Multiply the wall area by the brick count factor.</li>
            <li>Add an allowance for waste and breakage (typically 5-10%).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Common Brick Count Factors:</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Brick Size</th>
                <th>Bricks per sq ft</th>
                <th>Bricks per sq m</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Standard (3-5/8" × 2-1/4" × 8")</td>
                <td>6.75</td>
                <td>72.7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Modular (3-5/8" × 2-1/4" × 7-5/8")</td>
                <td>7</td>
                <td>75.3</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3>Formula:</h3>
        <div class="formula">
            Number of Bricks = Wall Area × Brick Count Factor × (1 + Waste Factor)
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Account for openings (windows, doors) by subtracting their area from the total wall area.</li>
        <li>Consider the bond pattern, as some patterns require more bricks than others.</li>
        <li>Factor in the thickness of mortar joints, which can affect the overall brick count.</li>
        <li>For more accurate results, consult with local masons or use specialized construction calculators.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Both methods have their merits. The theoretical method provides a precise calculation but may not account for all real-world variables. The practical method, while less exact, often yields results closer to actual construction needs. For best results, consider using both methods and comparing the outcomes.</p>

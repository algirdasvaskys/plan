    <h1>How to Build a Deck - Part 2: Joists and Decking</h1>
    
    <h2>Measuring, Cutting, and Fixing the Joists</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Measure and Mark Joist Locations</h3>
        <p>Begin by measuring and marking where your joists will be placed on the ledger board and beam. Typically, joists are spaced 16 inches on center for residential decks.</p>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Use a pencil or chalk line to mark the centers clearly.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Cut the Joists</h3>
        <p>Measure the distance between the ledger board and the beam, then cut your joists to this length. Remember to account for any overhang if your design includes one.</p>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Always measure twice and cut once to avoid wasting materials.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Install Joist Hangers</h3>
        <p>Attach joist hangers to the ledger board at each marked location using joist hanger nails or screws. Ensure they're level and properly aligned.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Place and Secure Joists</h3>
        <p>Place each joist into its corresponding hanger and secure it with nails or screws. At the beam end, toe-nail or use hurricane ties to secure the joists.</p>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Check for level and plumb as you go to ensure a flat deck surface.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Install Blocking</h3>
        <p>Add blocking between joists at the midpoint for additional support and to prevent twisting. Secure with nails or screws from both sides.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Choosing and Installing Decking</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Decking Material Options</h3>
        <p>There are several popular decking materials to choose from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pressure-treated lumber: Affordable and widely available</li>
            <li>Cedar or redwood: Naturally resistant to rot and insects</li>
            <li>Composite decking: Low maintenance and long-lasting</li>
            <li>PVC decking: Completely synthetic and highly durable</li>
            <li>Tropical hardwoods: Exotic look and very dense</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>My Choice: [Your chosen material]</h3>
        <p>[Explain why you chose this particular decking material, considering factors like cost, maintenance, durability, and aesthetics.]</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Installing the Decking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start at the house end of the deck, leaving a 1/8 inch gap between the first board and the house for drainage.</li>
            <li>Use deck screws or hidden fasteners to secure each board to the joists.</li>
            <li>Leave a 1/8 inch gap between boards for drainage and expansion.</li>
            <li>Use a spacer tool to maintain consistent gaps.</li>
            <li>Cut boards to length as needed, ensuring ends are supported by joists.</li>
            <li>For the last board, you may need to rip it lengthwise to fit.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Pre-drill holes near the ends of boards to prevent splitting.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Finishing Touches</h3>
        <p>Once all decking is installed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sand any rough spots or splinters.</li>
            <li>Apply finish or sealant if using natural wood.</li>
            <li>Install fascia boards to cover the end grain of decking and joists.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>With the joists installed and decking complete, your deck is taking shape! The next part will cover adding railings, stairs, and final touches to complete your outdoor living space.</p>

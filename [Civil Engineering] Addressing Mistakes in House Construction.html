    <h1>Addressing Mistakes During House Construction</h1>
    
    <p>Construction mistakes can occur in both new builds and renovation projects. Identifying and addressing these issues promptly is crucial for maintaining project quality, timeline, and budget. This guide outlines common mistakes and their solutions.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Foundation Issues</h2>
    <div class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake: Improper soil preparation or foundation layout</h3>
        <p>This can lead to settling, cracking, or structural instability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct a thorough soil analysis before beginning construction</li>
            <li>Ensure proper compaction of soil</li>
            <li>Use appropriate foundation design based on soil conditions</li>
            <li>If issues are discovered after pouring, consult a structural engineer for remediation options</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>2. Framing Errors</h2>
    <div class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake: Incorrect measurements or improper load-bearing support</h3>
        <p>This can affect the structural integrity and layout of the building.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Double-check all measurements before cutting materials</li>
            <li>Ensure proper placement of load-bearing walls and supports</li>
            <li>Use laser levels and other precision tools for accuracy</li>
            <li>If errors are discovered, consult the architect or engineer for necessary adjustments</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>3. Plumbing and Electrical Mistakes</h2>
    <div class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake: Incorrect placement of pipes or wiring</h3>
        <p>This can lead to functionality issues and costly repairs later.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Follow approved plans meticulously</li>
            <li>Use experienced, licensed professionals for these specialized tasks</li>
            <li>Conduct thorough inspections before closing up walls</li>
            <li>If mistakes are found, address them immediately, even if it means opening up finished work</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>4. Insulation and Weatherproofing Errors</h2>
    <div class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake: Inadequate or improperly installed insulation and weatherproofing</h3>
        <p>This can result in energy inefficiency and moisture problems.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure proper installation of vapor barriers and insulation</li>
            <li>Pay special attention to areas prone to air leaks, such as windows and doors</li>
            <li>Use appropriate materials for the climate and building design</li>
            <li>If issues are discovered post-construction, consider retrofitting problem areas</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>5. Finishing Mistakes</h2>
    <div class="mistake">
        <h3>Mistake: Poor quality finishes or mismatched materials</h3>

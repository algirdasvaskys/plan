    <h1>Distribution Board Connection for House Wiring</h1>
    <h2>Part 2: Distribution Board & Protection Devices</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>1. Distribution Board Overview</h3>
        <p>A distribution board, also known as a consumer unit or fuse box, is a crucial component in house wiring. It distributes electrical power to various circuits throughout the house while providing protection against overloads and short circuits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>2. Main Components of a Distribution Board</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Main Switch: Isolates the entire electrical installation from the power supply</li>
            <li>RCD (Residual Current Device): Protects against electric shock and some electrical fires</li>
            <li>MCBs (Miniature Circuit Breakers): Protect individual circuits from overload and short circuit</li>
            <li>Neutral Bar: Collects all neutral wires from different circuits</li>
            <li>Earth Bar: Collects all earth wires from different circuits</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>3. Connection Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Install the distribution board in a dry, easily accessible location</li>
            <li>Connect the main incoming supply to the main switch</li>
            <li>Connect the main earth wire to the earth bar</li>
            <li>Install and connect the RCD(s) as per the chosen split-load configuration</li>
            <li>Install MCBs for each circuit (lighting, power, etc.)</li>
            <li>Connect live wires from each circuit to their respective MCBs</li>
            <li>Connect neutral wires to the neutral bar</li>
            <li>Connect earth wires to the earth bar</li>
            <li>Label each circuit clearly for easy identification</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>4. Protection Devices</h3>
        <h4>4.1 Residual Current Device (RCD)</h4>
        <p>An RCD monitors the balance of current between live and neutral conductors. If it detects an imbalance (indicating a potential earth leakage), it quickly disconnects the circuit, providing protection against electric shock.</p>
        
        <h4>4.2 Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs)</h4>
        <p>MCBs protect individual circuits from overload and short circuit. They automatically trip and disconnect the circuit if the current exceeds the rated value. MCBs are classified based on their tripping characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Type B: For resistive loads (lighting, sockets)</li>
            <li>Type C: For slightly inductive loads (small motors)</li>
            <li>Type D: For highly inductive loads (large motors, transformers)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>5. Circuit Types and MCB Ratings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lighting Circuits: Typically 6A or 10A MCB</li>
            <li>Power Circuits (Sockets): Usually 20A or 32A MCB</li>
            <li>Cooker Circuit: 32A MCB</li>
            <li>Shower Circuit: 40A or 50A MCB</li>
            <li>Central Heating: 16A or 20A MCB</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>6. Safety Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Always turn off the main power supply before working on the distribution board</li>
            <li>Ensure proper earthing for all metal parts of the installation</li>
            <li>Use appropriately rated cables for each circuit</li>
            <li>Regularly test RCDs and MCBs to ensure they're functioning correctly</li>
            <li>Keep the distribution board area clear and easily accessible</li>
            <li>Consider future expansion when choosing the size of the distribution board</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>7. Maintenance and Inspection</h3>
        <p>Regular inspection and maintenance of the distribution board are essential for safe and efficient operation. It's recommended to have a professional electrician perform a thorough inspection every 5-10 years or when making significant changes to the electrical installation.</p>

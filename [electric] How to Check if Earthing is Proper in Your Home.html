    <h1>How to Check if Earthing is Proper in Your Home</h1>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Working with electrical systems can be dangerous. If you're not confident in your abilities, always consult a licensed electrician.
    </div>

    <p>Proper earthing (or grounding) is crucial for electrical safety in your home. Here are several methods to check if your home's earthing is adequate:</p>

    <div class="method">
        <h3>1. Visual Inspection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Look for the main earthing wire (usually green or bare copper) connected to a metal rod or plate buried in the ground.</li>
            <li>Check if all power outlets have three holes (for live, neutral, and earth).</li>
            <li>Ensure metal appliances and switch boxes are properly connected to the earth wire.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="method">
        <h3>2. Using a Multimeter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Set your multimeter to measure AC voltage.</li>
            <li>Measure voltage between neutral and earth (should be close to 0V).</li>
            <li>Measure voltage between live and earth (should be around 220-240V for most countries).</li>
            <li>If readings are significantly different, there might be an earthing issue.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="method">
        <h3>3. Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) Test</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Locate the ELCB in your home's distribution board.</li>
            <li>Press the 'Test' button on the ELCB.</li>
            <li>If it trips immediately, the earthing is likely proper. If it doesn't trip, there may be an earthing problem.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="method">
        <h3>4. Earth Resistance Test</h3>
        <p>This test requires specialized equipment and is best performed by a professional:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An earth resistance tester is used to measure the resistance between the earth electrode and the ground.</li>
            <li>The resistance should typically be less than 1 ohm for homes.</li>
            <li>Higher resistance indicates poor earthing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="method">
        <h3>5. Continuity Test</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a continuity tester or multimeter set to continuity mode.</li>
            <li>Test for continuity between the earth pin of power outlets and any exposed metal parts of fixed appliances.</li>
            <li>A continuous beep or low resistance reading indicates proper earthing connection.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>What to Do if Earthing is Improper</h2>
    <p>If you suspect your home's earthing is not proper:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not attempt to fix it yourself unless you are a qualified electrician.</li>
        <li>Contact a licensed electrician immediately to assess and rectify the issue.</li>
        <li>Avoid using appliances that require earthing until the problem is fixed.</li>
        <li>Consider installing additional safety devices like Residual Current Devices (RCDs) for extra protection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember, proper earthing is essential for your safety. Regular checks and maintenance can prevent electrical accidents and ensure the longevity of your electrical appliances.</p>

    <h1>The Big Build 13: Staircase Removal</h1>
    <h2>Taking out a staircase and associated timber floor construction</h2>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> This process involves structural changes to your building. Always consult with a structural engineer and obtain necessary permits before proceeding. Ensure proper safety measures are in place throughout the removal process.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Method:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn off all utilities (electricity, gas, water) that may be affected.</li>
                <li>Clear the area of furniture and valuables.</li>
                <li>Set up proper lighting and ventilation.</li>
                <li>Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE): hard hat, safety glasses, dust mask, work gloves, and steel-toed boots.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Remove handrails and balusters:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Start by removing any decorative elements, handrails, and balusters.</li>
                <li>Use a pry bar or screwdriver to remove fasteners.</li>
                <li>Be careful not to damage surrounding walls or flooring.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Remove treads and risers:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Start from the top of the staircase.</li>
                <li>Use a crowbar to pry up treads and risers.</li>
                <li>Remove any nails or screws securing them to the stringers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Remove stringers:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cut through the stringers using a reciprocating saw.</li>
                <li>Make cuts near the top and bottom where they connect to the floor and landing.</li>
                <li>Remove stringers carefully to avoid damaging surrounding structures.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Remove associated timber floor:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify the area of timber flooring to be removed.</li>
                <li>Use a circular saw to cut the flooring into manageable sections.</li>
                <li>Set the saw depth to slightly less than the thickness of the flooring to avoid damaging the subfloor.</li>
                <li>Pry up the cut sections using a pry bar or floor scraper.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Remove floor joists:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify load-bearing walls and consult with a structural engineer before removing joists.</li>
                <li>Use a reciprocating saw to cut through joist nails or hangers.</li>
                <li>Remove joists one at a time, working from one end to the other.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Structural reinforcement:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Consult with a structural engineer to determine if additional support is needed.</li>
                <li>Install any necessary beams, posts, or other structural elements as advised.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    <h1>Step-by-Step Guide: Connecting Phase Failure Relay with DOL Starter</h1>
    
    <p>This guide provides a detailed method for connecting a Phase Failure Relay with a Direct On-Line (DOL) Starter. Follow these steps carefully to ensure proper installation and functionality.</p>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Working with electrical equipment can be dangerous. Always ensure that power is disconnected before starting any work, and consult a qualified electrician if you're unsure about any step.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Materials Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Phase Failure Relay</li>
        <li>DOL Starter</li>
        <li>Wires</li>
        <li>Wire strippers</li>
        <li>Screwdriver</li>
        <li>Multimeter</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the workspace</h3>
        <p>Ensure the power is off and the area is clean and well-lit. Lay out all your materials and tools.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Identify the terminals</h3>
        <p>Locate the input and output terminals on both the Phase Failure Relay and the DOL Starter. Refer to the manufacturer's diagrams if necessary.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Connect the Phase Failure Relay to the power supply</h3>
        <p>Connect the three-phase power supply (L1, L2, L3) to the corresponding input terminals of the Phase Failure Relay.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Wire the Phase Failure Relay to the DOL Starter</h3>
        <p>Connect the output terminals of the Phase Failure Relay to the control circuit of the DOL Starter. Typically, this involves connecting to the coil of the main contactor.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Set up the DOL Starter</h3>
        <p>Wire the DOL Starter as per its manual, connecting the power supply, motor connections, and control circuit.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Connect the neutral (if required)</h3>
        <p>If your Phase Failure Relay requires a neutral connection, connect it to the neutral line.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Double-check all connections</h3>
        <p>Verify that all connections are secure and correctly made according to the wiring diagrams of both devices.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Set the Phase Failure Relay parameters</h3>
        <p>Adjust the settings on the Phase Failure Relay according to your specific requirements (e.g., voltage limits, time delay).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 9: Test the setup</h3>
        <p>Power on the system and test the functionality. The Phase Failure Relay should prevent the DOL Starter from operating if there's a phase failure or imbalance.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Safety Note:</strong> Always use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow all relevant safety guidelines and regulations when working with electrical systems.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By following these steps, you should have successfully connected a Phase Failure Relay with a DOL Starter. This setup will help protect your three-phase motor from potential damage due to phase failures or imbalances.</p>

    <h1>A Simple Trick to Modify the CT Ratio to Connect with Ammeter</h1>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Working with electrical equipment can be dangerous. Always follow proper safety procedures and consult with a qualified electrician before making any modifications.
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Current Transformers (CTs) are widely used in electrical systems to measure high currents. Sometimes, you may need to modify the CT ratio to connect it with an ammeter. This guide will walk you through the process.</p>

    <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Current Transformer (CT)</li>
        <li>Ammeter</li>
        <li>Insulated wire</li>
        <li>Wire cutters and strippers</li>
        <li>Electrical tape</li>
        <li>Multimeter (for testing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <p><span class="step-number">Step 1:</span> Understand the current CT ratio</p>
        <p>Before modifying, know your CT's current ratio. For example, a 100:5 CT means it can measure up to 100A and outputs 5A.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <p><span class="step-number">Step 2:</span> Determine the desired ratio</p>
        <p>Decide on the new ratio you need. For instance, if you want to measure 20A with a 5A ammeter, you'll need a 20:5 ratio.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <p><span class="step-number">Step 3:</span> Calculate the number of turns</p>
        <p>Use this formula: New turns = (Original primary current / Desired primary current) x Original turns
        <br>For example: (100A / 20A) x 1 turn = 5 turns</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <p><span class="step-number">Step 4:</span> Prepare the wire</p>
        <p>Cut a length of insulated wire that can wrap around the CT core the calculated number of times.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <p><span class="step-number">Step 5:</span> Wind the wire</p>
        <p>Carefully wind the wire around the CT core the calculated number of times. Ensure the windings are tight and don't overlap.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <p><span class="step-number">Step 6:</span> Secure the winding</p>
        <p>Use electrical tape to secure the windings in place, ensuring they don't move or come loose.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <p><span class="step-number">Step 7:</span> Connect to the ammeter</p>
        <p>Connect the ends of your newly wound wire to the ammeter, observing proper polarity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <p><span class="step-number">Step 8:</span> Test the setup</p>
        <p>Use a known current source and a multimeter to verify that your modified CT and ammeter are measuring correctly.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By following these steps, you can modify a CT's ratio to work with your ammeter. Remember to always prioritize safety and consult with a professional if you're unsure about any step in the process.</p>

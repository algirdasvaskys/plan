    <h1>How to Fit Joists Dead Flat</h1>
    
    <p>Fitting joists dead flat is crucial for creating a level and stable floor. This guide will walk you through the process step by step.</p>
    
    <h2>Materials Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Joists</li>
        <li>Spirit level or laser level</li>
        <li>Tape measure</li>
        <li>Pencil</li>
        <li>Circular saw or handsaw</li>
        <li>Shims</li>
        <li>Hammer</li>
        <li>Nails or screws</li>
        <li>Joist hangers (if required)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Area</h3>
        <p>Ensure the area where you'll be installing the joists is clean and free from debris. Check that supporting beams or walls are level and structurally sound.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Mark the Joist Positions</h3>
        <p>Measure and mark where each joist will be placed. Typically, joists are spaced 16 or 24 inches apart, depending on local building codes and the load they need to support.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Install the First Joist</h3>
        <p>Place the first joist in position. Use a spirit level or laser level to ensure it's perfectly level both horizontally and vertically. This first joist will serve as a reference for the others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Check and Adjust</h3>
        <p>If the joist isn't level, use shims to adjust it. Place shims under low spots until the joist is perfectly level. Secure the joist in place once it's level.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Install Remaining Joists</h3>
        <p>Continue installing the remaining joists, always checking for level. Use the first joist as a reference. Ensure each joist is the same height as the others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Use Joist Hangers</h3>
        <p>If required, install joist hangers for added support. Make sure they're securely fastened to both the supporting beam and the joist.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Final Level Check</h3>
        <p>Once all joists are installed, do a final level check across multiple joists. Use a long straight edge or string line to ensure all joists are in the same plane.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Make Adjustments</h3>
        <p>If any joists are higher or lower than others, make necessary adjustments. For high spots, you may need to plane down the joist. For low spots, use shims or sister joists to bring them up to level.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Pro Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Always check local building codes before starting your project.</li>
            <li>Use pressure-treated lumber for joists in areas prone to moisture.</li>
            <li>Consider using a laser level for increased accuracy, especially on larger projects.</li>
            <li>If using shims, cut them flush with the edge of the joist after installation.</li>
            <li>For very uneven surfaces, you may need to use adjustable joist hangers or create a laser-leveled grid system.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>By following these steps carefully, you'll be able to fit your joists dead flat, creating a solid foundation for your flooring project.</p>

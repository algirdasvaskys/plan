            <li>Measure and mark the pipe where it needs to be cut.</li>
            <li>Cut the pipe using a pipe cutter or fine-toothed saw.</li>
            <li>Remove any burrs from the cut end using a deburring tool.</li>
            <li>Clean both the pipe end and the inside of the fitting with a clean cloth.</li>
            <li>Apply CPVC primer to both the pipe end and the inside of the fitting.</li>
            <li>Apply CPVC cement to both the pipe end and the inside of the fitting.</li>
            <li>Insert the pipe into the fitting, twisting slightly for even distribution.</li>
            <li>Hold in place for 10-15 seconds to allow initial bonding.</li>

        <h2>4. Specific Applications</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 WC (Water Closet) Fittings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a 90-degree elbow to connect the water supply to the toilet tank.</li>
            <li>Install a shut-off valve between the water supply and the toilet for easy maintenance.</li>
            <li>Use a flexible supply line from the shut-off valve to the toilet tank.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4.2 Bathroom Fittings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For sinks, use tee fittings to branch off from the main supply line.</li>
            <li>Install individual shut-off valves for hot and cold water supplies.</li>
            <li>Use 90-degree elbows to route pipes around corners and to fixtures.</li>
            <li>For showers, use a mixing valve and appropriate fittings for temperature control.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4.3 Kitchen Fittings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use tee fittings to branch off for sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator water lines.</li>
            <li>Install shut-off valves for each appliance and the main sink supply.</li>
            <li>Use reducer fittings if transitioning from larger supply lines to smaller fixture lines.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Tips and Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow for expansion and contraction by using expansion loops or offsets in long runs.</li>
            <li>Support horizontal pipes every 3 feet and vertical pipes every 4 feet.</li>
            <li>Keep CPVC pipes at least 6 inches away from heat sources.</li>
            <li>Use thread sealant tape for threaded connections to prevent leaks.</li>
            <li>Pressure test the system before closing up walls or ceilings.</li>
            <li>Flush the system thoroughly before use to remove any debris or contaminants.</li>
        </ul>

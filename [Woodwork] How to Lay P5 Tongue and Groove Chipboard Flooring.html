    <h1>How to Lay P5 Tongue and Groove Chipboard Flooring</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>P5 tongue and groove chipboard flooring is a popular choice for both residential and commercial applications due to its durability, moisture resistance, and ease of installation. This guide will walk you through the process of laying P5 tongue and groove chipboard flooring.</p>
    
    <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>P5 tongue and groove chipboard flooring panels</li>
        <li>Saw (circular saw or jigsaw)</li>
        <li>Drill with screwdriver bit</li>
        <li>Hammer</li>
        <li>Tape measure</li>
        <li>Pencil</li>
        <li>Chalk line</li>
        <li>Wood glue (PVA)</li>
        <li>Flooring screws</li>
        <li>Expansion packers</li>
        <li>Safety equipment (goggles, dust mask, gloves)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Subfloor</h3>
        <p>Ensure the subfloor is clean, dry, and level. Remove any debris and check for any protruding nails or screws.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Acclimate the Chipboard</h3>
        <p>Allow the chipboard panels to acclimate to the room's temperature and humidity for at least 48 hours before installation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Plan the Layout</h3>
        <p>Measure the room and plan the layout of the panels. Start from the longest straight wall and work your way across the room.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Install the First Row</h3>
        <p>Cut the tongue off the panels for the first row. Place expansion packers against the wall to maintain a 10mm expansion gap. Lay the first row with the cut edge facing the wall.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Apply Adhesive</h3>
        <p>Apply a continuous bead of wood glue along the groove of each panel before fitting the next one.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Fit Subsequent Rows</h3>
        <p>For subsequent rows, insert the tongue into the groove of the previous row at a 45-degree angle, then lay the panel flat. Use a hammer and tapping block to ensure a tight fit.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Secure the Panels</h3>
        <p>Screw the panels to the joists or existing subfloor. Place screws 18mm from the panel edges and at 200mm intervals along the joists.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Cut Panels to Fit</h3>
        <p>Measure and cut panels to fit around obstacles or at the end of rows. Remember to maintain the expansion gap around the room's perimeter.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 9: Install the Final Row</h3>
        <p>For the final row, you may need to cut the panels lengthwise to fit. Remember to maintain the expansion gap.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 10: Finish Up</h3>
        <p>Remove the expansion packers and cover the expansion gaps with skirting boards or beading.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Important Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Always wear appropriate safety gear when cutting or drilling chipboard.</li>
            <li>Ensure proper ventilation when working with adhesives.</li>
            <li>Follow manufacturer's guidelines for specific product instructions.</li>
            <li>Allow the adhesive to dry completely before walking on the new floor or adding furniture.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By following these steps, you can successfully install P5 tongue and groove chipboard flooring. Remember to take your time, measure carefully, and maintain safety practices throughout the installation process.</p>

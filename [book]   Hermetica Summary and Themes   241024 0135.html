    <h1>Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius</h1>
    <div class="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The Corpus Hermeticum is a collection of texts attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary Hellenistic figure who is a fusion of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. These writings are primarily dialogues in which Hermes imparts spiritual knowledge to his disciples. The Latin Asclepius is a related text that delves into similar philosophical and theological themes. Together, they form the foundation of Hermeticism, a philosophical and spiritual tradition that emphasizes the pursuit of gnosis, or direct knowledge of the divine.</p>

        <h2>Themes</h2>
        <div class="theme-item">
            <h3>Divine Knowledge and Gnosis</h3>
            <p>Hermetic texts focus on the pursuit of gnosis, a deep, intuitive understanding of divine truths beyond ordinary rational thought. This knowledge is seen as the key to spiritual awakening and transformation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="theme-item">
            <h3>The Unity of All Things</h3>
            <p>The Hermetica emphasizes the interconnectedness of the universe, asserting that all things emerge from a single divine source and are fundamentally one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="theme-item">
            <h3>The As Above, So Below Principle</h3>
            <p>This principle reflects the belief that the microcosm (individual) is a reflection of the macrocosm (universe), suggesting a profound symmetry between the human soul and the cosmos.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="theme-item">
            <h3>Transformation and Rebirth</h3>
            <p>Hermeticism teaches that spiritual enlightenment leads to a metaphorical rebirth, transforming the individual into a more divine and enlightened being.</p>

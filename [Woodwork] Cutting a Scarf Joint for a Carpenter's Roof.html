    <h1>Cutting a Scarf Joint for a Carpenter's Roof</h1>
    
    <p>A scarf joint is a method of joining two pieces of timber end-to-end, often used in carpentry for extending roof rafters or purlins. This guide will walk you through the process of cutting a scarf joint for a carpenter's roof.</p>

    <div class="safety-note">
        <h3>Safety First!</h3>
        <p>Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including safety glasses, ear protection, and a dust mask. Ensure your work area is well-ventilated and your tools are in good condition.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Tools and Materials Needed</h2>
    <div class="tool-list">
        <ul>
            <li>Timber pieces to be joined</li>
            <li>Pencil</li>
            <li>Carpenter's square</li>
            <li>Tape measure</li>
            <li>Hand saw or power saw (circular saw or reciprocating saw)</li>
            <li>Chisel set</li>
            <li>Mallet or hammer</li>
            <li>Sandpaper</li>
            <li>Wood glue</li>
            <li>Clamps</li>
            <li>Bolts, nuts, and washers (if required)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Steps to Cut a Scarf Joint</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Mark the Scarf Cut</h3>
        <p>Measure and mark the length of the scarf cut on both timber pieces. A typical scarf joint is cut at a 1:8 ratio, meaning for every inch of timber thickness, the scarf should be 8 inches long.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Make the First Cut</h3>
        <p>Using your saw, make the first angled cut along the marked line. Ensure the cut is straight and smooth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Cut the Notches</h3>
        <p>Measure and mark the positions for the notches. These are typically one-third the depth of the timber and positioned at the ends of the scarf cut. Use a chisel and mallet to carefully remove the wood to create the notches.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Test Fit</h3>
        <p>Place the two pieces together to check the fit. The joint should be snug with no gaps. Make any necessary adjustments using your chisel.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Sand and Prepare</h3>
        <p>Sand the surfaces of the joint to ensure they're smooth and clean. Remove any dust or debris.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Apply Glue</h3>
        <p>Apply a generous amount of wood glue to both surfaces of the joint.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Clamp and Secure</h3>
        <p>Bring the two pieces together and clamp them tightly. Wipe away any excess glue that squeezes out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Reinforce (Optional)</h3>
        <p>For additional strength, you may want to reinforce the joint with bolts. If so, drill holes through the joint and insert bolts with washers and nuts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 9: Allow to Dry</h3>
        <p>Leave the joint clamped and undisturbed for the time recommended by the glue manufacturer, typically 24 hours.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 10: Final Touches</h3>
        <p>Once dry, remove the clamps and sand the joint smooth. Your scarf joint is now ready for use in your roof construction.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Remember, practice makes perfect. If this is your first time cutting a scarf joint, consider practicing on some scrap wood before working on your actual roof timbers.</p>

    <div class="method">
        <h2>What You'll Need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>White vinegar</li>
            <li>A large container (plastic or glass)</li>
            <li>An old toothbrush or wire brush</li>
            <li>Steel wool or sandpaper</li>
            <li>Clean cloths</li>
            <li>Protective gloves</li>
            <li>Baking soda (optional)</li>
            <li>Mineral oil or machine oil</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="method">
        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the vinegar bath:</strong> Fill your container with white vinegar, ensuring there's enough to fully submerge the rusty tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Soak the tools:</strong> Place the rusty tools in the vinegar bath. For light rust, soak for 12-24 hours. For heavy rust, you may need to soak for up to 3-4 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Check progress:</strong> Periodically check on your tools. You should see the rust starting to loosen and flake off.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrub the tools:</strong> After soaking, put on your protective gloves and use the old toothbrush or wire brush to scrub off the loosened rust. For stubborn areas, use steel wool or sandpaper.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutralize the acid:</strong> Once the rust is removed, neutralize the acid by making a paste of baking soda and water. Apply this to the tools and rinse thoroughly with clean water.</li>
            <li><strong>Dry thoroughly:</strong> Use clean cloths to dry the tools completely. Make sure no moisture remains to prevent new rust from forming.</li>
            <li><strong>Apply oil:</strong> To protect your freshly cleaned tools from future rust, apply a thin layer of mineral oil or machine oil.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>For valuable or antique tools, consult a professional before attempting this method.</li>

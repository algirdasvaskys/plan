    <h1>How to Wire a DOL Starter to Turn ON & OFF from Two Different Places</h1>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Working with electrical systems can be dangerous. Always ensure that the power is turned off before working on any electrical connections. If you're not confident in your abilities, please consult a qualified electrician.
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A Direct-On-Line (DOL) starter is a common method of starting a three-phase induction motor. This guide will show you how to wire a DOL starter so that it can be controlled from two different locations.</p>

    <h2>Components Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>DOL Starter</li>
        <li>3-Phase Induction Motor</li>
        <li>Two Double Pole Double Throw (DPDT) switches</li>
        <li>Power supply</li>
        <li>Wires</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wiring Steps</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect the power supply to the DOL starter's input terminals.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Connect the DOL starter's output terminals to the motor.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> Wire the control circuit:
            <ul>
                <li>Connect one pole of each DPDT switch in series.</li>
                <li>Connect the other pole of each switch in parallel.</li>
                <li>Connect one end of this circuit to the DOL starter's control input.</li>
                <li>Connect the other end to the control power supply (usually 24V DC or 230V AC).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Connect the control power supply neutral to the DOL starter's neutral terminal.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Ground all components properly.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Operation</h2>
    <p>With this wiring setup, you can turn the motor ON or OFF from either location. The switches at both locations will be able to control the motor independently.</p>

    <h2>Safety Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Always use properly rated components for your specific application.</li>
        <li>Ensure all connections are secure and properly insulated.</li>
        <li>Install appropriate circuit protection devices (fuses or circuit breakers).</li>
        <li>Follow all local electrical codes and regulations.</li>
        <li>If you're not experienced with electrical work, consult a professional electrician.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Maintenance</h2>
    <p>Regularly inspect all connections and components for signs of wear or damage. Clean the starter and switches periodically to prevent dust accumulation. Replace any damaged parts immediately.</p>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>If the system doesn't work as expected:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check all connections for loose wires.</li>
        <li>Verify that both switches are functioning correctly.</li>
        <li>Ensure the DOL starter is receiving power and functioning properly.</li>
        <li>Test the motor independently to ensure it's working.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember, safety should always be your top priority when working with electrical systems. If you encounter any issues you're not comfortable addressing, please consult a qualified electrician.</p>

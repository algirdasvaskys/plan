    <h1>How to Fit Fascia Boards</h1>

    <p>Fascia boards are an essential part of your roof's structure, protecting the edge of the roof and supporting the guttering. This guide will walk you through the process of fitting fascia boards.</p>

    <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fascia boards</li>
        <li>Nails or screws</li>
        <li>Hammer or drill</li>
        <li>Saw</li>
        <li>Measuring tape</li>
        <li>Level</li>
        <li>Paint or wood preservative</li>
        <li>Ladder or scaffolding</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Preparation</h3>
        <p>Ensure you have a stable working platform, either a ladder or scaffolding. Safety should be your top priority when working at height.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Remove Old Fascia</h3>
        <p>If you're replacing old fascia boards, carefully remove them along with any old nails or fixings. Inspect the rafters for any signs of rot or damage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Measure and Cut</h3>
        <p>Measure the length needed for your fascia board and cut it to size using a saw. Remember to account for any joints or corners.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Treat the Wood</h3>
        <p>Apply wood preservative or paint to all sides of the fascia board, including the cut ends. This will help protect it from moisture and extend its lifespan.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Position the Fascia</h3>
        <p>Hold the fascia board in place against the rafter ends. Use a level to ensure it's straight. The top edge of the fascia should be flush with the top of the rafters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Secure the Fascia</h3>
        <p>Nail or screw the fascia board to each rafter end. Use at least two fixings per rafter for added stability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Join Boards</h3>
        <p>If you need to join two fascia boards, do so at a rafter. Cut the boards at 45-degree angles and join them with a butt joint.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Corners</h3>
        <p>For corners, cut the boards at 45-degree angles to create a neat miter joint. Secure both pieces to the corner rafter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 9: Final Touches</h3>
        <p>Once all fascia boards are in place, give them a final coat of paint or wood preservative for added protection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Safety Warning</h3>
        <p>Always prioritize safety when working at height. Use proper equipment, wear protective gear, and if you're unsure about any aspect of the job, consult a professional.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Maintenance</h2>
    <p>Regularly inspect your fascia boards for signs of wear, rot, or damage. Repaint or treat the wood every few years to maintain its protective qualities and appearance.</p>

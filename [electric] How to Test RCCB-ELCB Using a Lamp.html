    <h2>What is RCCB/ELCB?</h2>
    <p>RCCB (Residual Current Circuit Breaker) or ELCB (Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker) are safety devices designed to quickly disconnect the electrical circuit when they detect an imbalance between the incoming and outgoing current, which could indicate a ground fault.</p>

    <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A lamp (preferably incandescent) with a plug</li>
        <li>A multimeter (optional, for additional testing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure the RCCB/ELCB is in the 'ON' position.</li>
        <li>Plug the lamp into an outlet protected by the RCCB/ELCB.</li>
        <li>Turn on the lamp. It should light up normally.</li>
        <li>Locate the test button on the RCCB/ELCB. It's usually marked with a 'T' or 'Test'.</li>
        <li>Press the test button.</li>
        <li>The RCCB/ELCB should trip immediately, and the lamp should turn off.</li>
        <li>If the RCCB/ELCB doesn't trip or the lamp stays on, the device may be faulty and should be replaced by a qualified electrician.</li>
        <li>After a successful test, reset the RCCB/ELCB by switching it back to the 'ON' position.</li>
        <li>The lamp should now turn on again when you switch it on.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Perform this test monthly to ensure the RCCB/ELCB is functioning correctly.</li>
        <li>If the RCCB/ELCB trips frequently during normal use, it could indicate a wiring problem or a faulty appliance. Consult an electrician.</li>
        <li>Some modern RCCB/ELCBs have a built-in self-test feature. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for these devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Regular testing of your RCCB/ELCB is crucial for maintaining electrical safety in your home or workplace. If you're unsure about any aspect of electrical testing or maintenance, always consult a qualified electrician.</p>

    <h1>Automictic Day & Night Sensor Connection for Street Light</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>An automictic day and night sensor is an essential component for efficient street lighting systems. It automatically controls the street light based on ambient light conditions, turning the light on at dusk and off at dawn. This guide will walk you through the process of connecting such a sensor to a street light.</p>

    <h2>Components Required</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Automictic day and night sensor</li>
        <li>Street light fixture</li>
        <li>Electrical wires (typically 14 or 12 AWG)</li>
        <li>Wire connectors</li>
        <li>Screwdriver</li>
        <li>Wire strippers</li>
        <li>Electrical tape</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Connection Steps</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Safety First</h3>
        <p>Before beginning any electrical work, ensure that the power supply to the street light is turned off at the main circuit breaker. Use a voltage tester to confirm that there is no live current in the wires.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Warning</h3>
        <p>Working with electrical systems can be dangerous. If you're not confident in your abilities, please consult a licensed electrician.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Locate the Junction Box</h3>
        <p>Find the junction box on the street light pole where the electrical connections are made.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Install the Sensor</h3>
        <p>Mount the automictic day and night sensor in a location where it can accurately detect ambient light levels. Usually, this is near the top of the street light fixture, facing north in the northern hemisphere (or south in the southern hemisphere) to avoid direct sunlight.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Wire Connections</h3>
        <p>The sensor typically has three wires:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Black (Hot)</li>
            <li>White (Neutral)</li>
            <li>Red (Load)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Connect these wires as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Connect the black wire from the sensor to the black (hot) wire from the power source.</li>
            <li>Connect the white wire from the sensor to the white (neutral) wire from the power source and the street light fixture.</li>
            <li>Connect the red wire from the sensor to the black wire of the street light fixture.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Secure Connections</h3>
        <p>Use wire connectors to secure each connection. Wrap each connection with electrical tape for added insulation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Test the Connection</h3>
        <p>Once all connections are secure, turn the power back on at the circuit breaker. Cover the sensor to simulate darkness - the street light should turn on. Uncover the sensor to simulate daylight - the street light should turn off after a short delay.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the light doesn't turn on, check all connections and ensure the power is on at the circuit breaker.</li>
        <li>If the light stays on during the day, ensure the sensor is not obstructed or in a shaded area.</li>
        <li>If the light flickers, there may be a loose connection. Turn off the power and check all wire connections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Maintenance</h2>
    <p>Regularly clean the sensor to ensure it can accurately detect light levels. Inspect connections annually to ensure they remain secure and free from corrosion.</p>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Final Note</h3>
        <p>Always prioritize safety when working with electrical systems. If you encounter any issues or are unsure about any step, consult a professional electrician.</p>

    <h1>VLSI: Very Large Scale Integration</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is VLSI?</h2>
        <p>VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) refers to the process of creating integrated circuits by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip. This technology emerged in the 1970s and has since revolutionized the electronics industry, enabling the creation of complex, high-performance, and compact electronic devices.</p>

        <h2>VLSI Design Flow</h2>
        <p>The VLSI design flow is a systematic approach to creating integrated circuits. It typically involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Specification: Defining the functionality and performance requirements of the chip.</li>
            <li>Architectural Design: Creating a high-level design of the system components.</li>
            <li>RTL Design: Describing the circuit's behavior using a hardware description language (HDL) like VHDL or Verilog.</li>
            <li>Logic Synthesis: Converting the RTL description into a gate-level netlist.</li>
            <li>Floor Planning: Arranging the major functional blocks on the chip.</li>
            <li>Place and Route: Placing the individual components and routing the connections between them.</li>
            <li>Physical Verification: Checking for design rule violations and ensuring manufacturability.</li>
            <li>Timing Analysis: Verifying that the circuit meets timing requirements.</li>
            <li>Fabrication: Manufacturing the actual chip in a semiconductor foundry.</li>
            <li>Testing and Packaging: Verifying the chip's functionality and packaging it for use.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How VLSI Chips are Built</h2>
        <p>The process of building VLSI chips involves several key steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wafer Production: Silicon wafers are created from high-purity silicon ingots.</li>
            <li>Photolithography: The circuit pattern is projected onto the wafer using UV light and photoresist.</li>
            <li>Etching: Unwanted material is removed to create the circuit pattern.</li>
            <li>Doping: Impurities are introduced to alter the electrical properties of specific regions.</li>
            <li>Deposition: Layers of conducting and insulating materials are added to create interconnects.</li>
            <li>Planarization: The surface is smoothed to prepare for the next layer.</li>
            <li>Metallization: Metal layers are added to create connections between components.</li>
            <li>Passivation: A protective layer is added to shield the chip from the environment.</li>
            <li>Testing: The wafer is tested for defects.</li>
            <li>Packaging: Individual chips are cut from the wafer and packaged for use.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This process is repeated multiple times to create the complex, multi-layer structure of modern VLSI chips.</p>

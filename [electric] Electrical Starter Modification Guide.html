    <h1>Electrical Starter Modification Guide</h1>
    
    <p>This guide will walk you through the process of modifying an electrical starter using a schematic diagram. Please follow each step carefully to ensure a safe and successful modification.</p>
    
    <h2>Schematic Diagram</h2>
    <div class="schematic">
        <!-- Schematic diagram would be drawn here using SVG -->
        <svg width="600" height="400" viewBox="0 0 600 400">
            <!-- Example schematic elements -->
            <rect x="50" y="50" width="100" height="50" fill="none" stroke="black" />
            <text x="100" y="80" text-anchor="middle">Starter</text>
            <line x1="150" y1="75" x2="250" y2="75" stroke="black" />
            <circle cx="300" cy="75" r="25" fill="none" stroke="black" />
            <text x="300" y="80" text-anchor="middle">M</text>

    </div>
    
    <h2>Modification Steps</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Safety First</h3>
        <p>Before beginning any work, ensure that the vehicle's battery is disconnected and all power sources are isolated. Wear appropriate safety gear, including insulated gloves and safety glasses.</p>
        <p class="warning">Warning: Working with electrical systems can be dangerous. If you're unsure about any step, consult a professional mechanic or electrician.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Locate the Starter</h3>
        <p>Identify the starter motor in your vehicle. It's typically located near the intersection of the engine and transmission.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Remove the Starter</h3>
        <p>Disconnect the wiring harness from the starter. Remove the mounting bolts and carefully extract the starter from the vehicle.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Disassemble the Starter</h3>
        <p>Carefully disassemble the starter, taking note of how each component fits together. You may need to refer to the schematic diagram during this process.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Modify the Solenoid</h3>
        <p>Locate the solenoid on the starter. According to the schematic, you'll need to modify the wiring connections to improve the electrical flow. This may involve replacing worn contacts or upgrading the wire gauge.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Upgrade the Brushes</h3>
        <p>Replace the existing brushes with high-performance alternatives. Ensure they match the specifications outlined in the schematic diagram.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Reassemble the Starter</h3>
        <p>Carefully reassemble the starter, ensuring all components are correctly positioned as per the schematic. Double-check all connections and moving parts.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Reinstall the Starter</h3>
        <p>Mount the modified starter back into the vehicle. Secure it with the mounting bolts and reconnect the wiring harness.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 9: Test the Modification</h3>
        <p>Reconnect the vehicle's battery and test the starter. It should engage more quickly and provide more consistent starts.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By following this guide and referring to the schematic diagram, you've successfully modified your electrical starter. This modification should improve your vehicle's starting performance, especially in cold weather conditions.</p>
    
    <p class="warning">Remember: If you encounter any issues or are unsure about any step in the process, it's always best to consult with a professional mechanic or automotive electrician.</p>

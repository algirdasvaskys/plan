    <h1>The Big Build - Episode 38: Plasterboarding and First Fix</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to another exciting episode of The Big Build! Today, we're diving into the crucial stages of plasterboarding and first fix in construction. These steps are essential for creating a solid foundation for your interior walls and preparing for the installation of utilities.</p>

    <h2>Plasterboarding</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Area</h3>
        <p>Ensure the wall framing is complete, level, and secure. Remove any debris or protruding nails/screws.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Measure and Cut</h3>
        <p>Measure the wall dimensions and cut plasterboards to size using a utility knife and straight edge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Apply Adhesive</h3>
        <p>Apply dabs of adhesive to the wall studs or joists in a grid pattern.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Position the Plasterboard</h3>
        <p>Lift the plasterboard into position, pressing it firmly against the adhesive dabs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Secure the Plasterboard</h3>
        <p>Use drywall screws to secure the plasterboard to the studs, spacing them about 30cm apart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
        <p>Start from the top of the wall and work your way down. This helps prevent sagging and ensures a smooth finish.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>First Fix</h2>

    <p>The first fix stage involves installing the initial elements of electrical, plumbing, and heating systems before the walls are fully closed up.</p>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Electrical Wiring</h3>
        <p>Run electrical cables through the wall cavities, securing them with cable clips. Install back boxes for switches and sockets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Plumbing</h3>
        <p>Install water supply pipes and waste pipes. Ensure proper support and allow for thermal expansion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Heating</h3>
        <p>Install radiator pipes or underfloor heating elements as required.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Ventilation</h3>
        <p>Install ventilation ducts and outlets for bathrooms and kitchens.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
        <p>Always follow local building codes and regulations. It's often required to have first fix work inspected before proceeding to the next stage.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Proper plasterboarding and first fix work are crucial for creating a solid foundation for your interior finish and ensuring smooth operation of utilities. Take your time, plan carefully, and don't hesitate to consult professionals when needed. In our next episode, we'll cover the second fix stage. Stay tuned!</p>

    <h1>Fitting a New Korniche Roof Lantern</h1>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Fitting a roof lantern involves working at height and handling large, heavy materials. If you're not confident in your DIY skills or don't have experience with this type of work, it's recommended to hire a professional.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Tools and Materials Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Korniche roof lantern kit</li>
        <li>Drill with appropriate bits</li>
        <li>Screwdriver</li>
        <li>Spirit level</li>
        <li>Tape measure</li>
        <li>Silicone sealant and gun</li>
        <li>Safety equipment (gloves, goggles, hard hat)</li>
        <li>Ladder or scaffolding</li>
        <li>Assistant (recommended)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Installation Process:</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Roof Opening</h3>
        <p>Ensure the roof opening is clean, dry, and structurally sound. The opening should be slightly larger than the external dimensions of the lantern to allow for fitting.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Install the Timber Kerb</h3>
        <p>If not already in place, install a timber kerb around the roof opening. This should be level and securely fixed to the roof structure.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Apply Weatherproofing</h3>
        <p>Apply a layer of weatherproof membrane or flashing to the timber kerb, ensuring it overlaps onto the roof to prevent water ingress.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Position the Korniche Frame</h3>
        <p>Carefully lift the Korniche frame onto the prepared kerb. Check it's square and level, adjusting as necessary.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Secure the Frame</h3>
        <p>Use the provided fixings to secure the frame to the kerb. Ensure all fixings are tight but be careful not to over-tighten.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Install the Glazing</h3>
        <p>Carefully place the glazing units into the frame, starting with the larger sheets first. Secure using the provided glazing retainers and caps.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Fit the Ridge and Hip Caps</h3>
        <p>Install the ridge cap along the top of the lantern and the hip caps along the corners, ensuring they're properly aligned and secure.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Apply Sealant</h3>
        <p>Apply silicone sealant to all joints and any areas where water could potentially enter.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 9: Final Checks</h3>
        <p>Double-check all fixings are secure, the lantern is level, and all seals are in place. Clean any excess sealant or fingerprints from the glass and frame.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Always follow the manufacturer's specific instructions provided with your Korniche roof lantern kit. These steps are a general guide and may vary slightly depending on your specific model and roof configuration.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Maintenance</h2>
    <p>To keep your Korniche roof lantern in good condition:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean the glass regularly with a mild detergent solution</li>
        <li>Check and clean the drainage channels annually</li>
        <li>Inspect seals and sealant annually, replacing if necessary</li>

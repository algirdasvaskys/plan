    <h1>Centrifugal Pump Basics: How They Work</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Centrifugal pumps are widely used in various industries, including HVACR (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration). They are essential for moving fluids through systems efficiently.</p>
    
    <h2>Working Principle</h2>
    <p>The centrifugal pump operates on the principle of centrifugal force. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Impeller Rotation:</strong> The pump's main component is the impeller, which is connected to a motor. As the motor runs, it causes the impeller to rotate at high speeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Fluid Entry:</strong> The fluid enters the pump through the eye (center) of the impeller.</li>
        <li><strong>Centrifugal Force:</strong> As the impeller rotates, it imparts centrifugal force to the fluid, throwing it outward from the center to the outer edge of the impeller.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure Increase:</strong> This outward movement creates a low-pressure area at the impeller's eye, drawing in more fluid, while simultaneously increasing the pressure at the impeller's outer edge.</li>
        <li><strong>Volute Collection:</strong> The high-pressure fluid is collected in the pump's volute (a spiral-shaped casing), which converts the velocity energy into pressure energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Discharge:</strong> Finally, the fluid is discharged from the pump at high pressure through the outlet.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Key Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Impeller:</strong> The rotating component that imparts energy to the fluid.</li>
        <li><strong>Volute:</strong> The stationary housing that collects and directs the fluid.</li>
        <li><strong>Shaft:</strong> Connects the impeller to the motor.</li>
        <li><strong>Bearings:</strong> Support the shaft and allow it to rotate smoothly.</li>
        <li><strong>Seals:</strong> Prevent leakage where the shaft enters the pump casing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Centrifugal Pumps</h2>
    <p>There are several types of centrifugal pumps, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Radial flow pumps</li>
        <li>Axial flow pumps</li>
        <li>Mixed flow pumps</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications in HVACR</h2>
    <p>In HVACR systems, centrifugal pumps are used for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chilled water circulation in air conditioning systems</li>
        <li>Condenser water circulation in cooling towers</li>
        <li>Hot water circulation in heating systems</li>
        <li>Refrigerant circulation in large refrigeration systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>High efficiency for large flow rates</li>
        <li>Smooth, continuous flow</li>
        <li>Relatively simple design with few moving parts</li>
        <li>Can handle a wide range of liquids</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Centrifugal pumps are crucial components in many HVACR systems, providing efficient fluid movement through the principle of centrifugal force. Understanding their working principle helps in proper selection, operation, and maintenance of these pumps in various applications.</p>

    <h1>The Big Build 14: Building New Brickwork for Extensions</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This guide provides a comprehensive method for building new brickwork to form extensions as part of The Big Build 14 project. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a sturdy and professional construction.</p>
    
    <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bricks</li>
        <li>Mortar mix</li>
        <li>Sand</li>
        <li>Cement</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Trowel</li>
        <li>Level</li>
        <li>String line</li>
        <li>Tape measure</li>
        <li>Brick hammer</li>
        <li>Jointing tool</li>
        <li>Wheelbarrow</li>
        <li>Bucket</li>
        <li>Safety equipment (gloves, goggles, dust mask)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Method</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Foundation</h3>
        <p>Ensure the foundation is level, clean, and damp-proofed. Mark out the dimensions of the extension using string lines and pegs.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Mix the Mortar</h3>
        <p>In a wheelbarrow, mix 1 part cement to 4-5 parts building sand. Add water gradually until you achieve a consistent, workable mixture.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Lay the First Course</h3>
        <p>Spread a layer of mortar along the foundation. Place the first brick at a corner, then use a string line to ensure subsequent bricks are straight. Use the level to check each brick is level both horizontally and vertically.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Build Up the Corners</h3>
        <p>Build up the corners first, using a plumb line to ensure they're straight. This will serve as a guide for the rest of the wall.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Lay Subsequent Courses</h3>
        <p>Continue laying bricks in a running bond pattern (each vertical joint should be centered on the brick below). Apply mortar to the top and ends of each brick before placing.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Check for Level and Plumb</h3>
        <p>Regularly check that the wall is level horizontally and plumb vertically. Use a spirit level and plumb line.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Cut Bricks as Needed</h3>
        <p>Use a brick hammer or masonry saw to cut bricks when necessary, such as at the ends of rows or around windows and doors.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Install Lintels and Damp Proof Course</h3>
        <p>Install lintels above openings for windows and doors. Remember to include a damp proof course where necessary.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 9: Point the Joints</h3>
        <p>Once the mortar has begun to set (but before it's fully hardened), use a jointing tool to finish the mortar joints for a neat appearance.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 10: Clean and Finish</h3>
        <p>Clean any excess mortar from the face of the bricks. Allow the wall to cure for at least 24 hours before continuing with further construction work.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Safety Warning</h3>
        <p>Always wear appropriate safety gear, including gloves, goggles, and a dust mask. Be cautious when lifting heavy materials and working at heights. If you're unsure about any aspect of the construction, consult a professional.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Pro Tip</h3>
        <p>To ensure consistency in your mortar joints, use a piece of wood cut to the desired joint thickness as a spacer between bricks.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By following these steps, you should be able to successfully build new brickwork for your extension as part of The Big Build 14 project. Remember that bricklaying is a skill that improves with practice, so take your time and focus on maintaining consistent levels and joint thicknesses throughout the build.</p>

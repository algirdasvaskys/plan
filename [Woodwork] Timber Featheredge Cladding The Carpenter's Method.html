    <h1>Timber Featheredge Cladding: The Carpenter's Method</h1>
    
    <p>This guide will walk you through the process of setting out, measuring, cutting, and fixing timber featheredge cladding using traditional carpentry techniques.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Setting Out</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <ol>
            <li>Inspect the wall surface for evenness. Address any irregularities.</li>
            <li>Install a damp-proof course (DPC) if the cladding starts near ground level.</li>
            <li>Fix vertical battens to the wall at regular intervals (typically 400-600mm apart).</li>
            <li>Ensure battens are plumb using a spirit level.</li>
            <li>Install additional battens around openings and at corners.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Use treated timber for battens to prevent rot and insect infestation.
    </div>
    
    <h2>2. Measuring</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <ol>
            <li>Measure the height of the wall to determine the number of boards needed.</li>
            <li>Calculate the exposed face of each board (typically 125-150mm).</li>
            <li>Measure and mark the starting point for the first board, ensuring it's level.</li>
            <li>Use a story pole to mark consistent board heights along the wall.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Allow for a 15mm overlap between boards for proper water run-off.
    </div>
    
    <h2>3. Cutting</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <ol>
            <li>Use a sharp handsaw or power saw to cut boards to length.</li>
            <li>For angled cuts at corners, use a miter saw or carefully mark and cut by hand.</li>
            <li>Sand cut edges to remove splinters and achieve a clean finish.</li>
            <li>Pre-drill nail holes to prevent splitting, especially near board ends.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Cut boards slightly longer than needed and trim to fit for a precise installation.
    </div>
    
    <h2>4. Fixing</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <ol>
            <li>Start at the bottom of the wall, fixing a starter strip to support the first board.</li>
            <li>Nail the first board in place, ensuring it's level.</li>
            <li>Use galvanized or stainless steel nails to prevent rusting.</li>
            <li>Continue upwards, overlapping each board by 15mm.</li>
            <li>Check for level and plumb every few boards.</li>
            <li>Cut and fit boards around windows, doors, and other openings.</li>
            <li>Install corner boards or miter joints at external corners.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Leave a small expansion gap (about 3mm) between boards to allow for natural wood movement.
    </div>
    
    <h2>5. Finishing Touches</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <ol>
            <li>Install trim pieces around windows and doors.</li>
            <li>Apply a suitable wood preservative or paint to protect the cladding.</li>
            <li>Caulk any gaps to ensure weathertightness.</li>
            <li>Clean up the work area and dispose of waste responsibly.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Regular maintenance, including cleaning and repainting, will extend the life of your featheredge cladding.
    </div>
    
    <p>By following these steps, you'll be able to install timber featheredge cladding like a professional carpenter. Remember to always prioritize safety, use appropriate tools, and work methodically for the best results.</p>

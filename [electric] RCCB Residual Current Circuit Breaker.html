    <h1>RCCB: Residual Current Circuit Breaker</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is an RCCB?</h2>
        <p>An RCCB (Residual Current Circuit Breaker) is a safety device used in electrical installations to protect people from electric shocks and prevent electrical fires. It detects small leakages of current in a circuit and quickly disconnects the power supply when a fault is detected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>RCCB Working Principle</h2>
        <p>The working principle of an RCCB is based on Kirchhoff's current law and the detection of imbalance in current flow. Here's how it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a normal circuit, the current flowing in the live wire should be equal to the current returning through the neutral wire.</li>
            <li>The RCCB contains a current transformer that monitors the balance between these currents.</li>
            <li>If there's a leakage (e.g., current flowing to earth through a person), it creates an imbalance.</li>
            <li>When this imbalance exceeds a preset threshold (typically 30mA for domestic use), the RCCB trips and disconnects the circuit.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Key Point: RCCBs can detect current imbalances as small as 5-30 milliamperes and react within 25-40 milliseconds, which is fast enough to prevent severe electric shock.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why We Should Use RCCB</h2>
        <p>There are several crucial reasons to use RCCBs in electrical installations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protection against electric shock:</strong> RCCBs can detect small leakage currents that are too low to trigger standard circuit breakers but could still be lethal to humans.</li>
            <li><strong>Fire prevention:</strong> By detecting earth leakage currents, RCCBs can prevent electrical fires caused by faulty wiring or appliances.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance with regulations:</strong> Many countries require the use of RCCBs in certain types of electrical installations, especially in wet areas like bathrooms and outdoors.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced safety for old wiring:</strong> In older buildings with deteriorating wiring, RCCBs provide an additional layer of protection.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Types of RCCB</h2>
        <p>There are several types of RCCBs, categorized based on their sensitivity and application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>AC Type:</strong> Designed to detect AC leakage currents. This is the most common type for domestic use.</li>
            <li><strong>A Type:</strong> Can detect both AC and pulsating DC leakage currents. Suitable for circuits with electronic devices.</li>
            <li><strong>F Type:</strong> Similar to Type A, but with enhanced sensitivity for high-frequency leakage currents.</li>
            <li><strong>B Type:</strong> Can detect AC, pulsating DC, and smooth DC leakage currents. Used in industrial applications and EV charging stations.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>RCCBs are also classified based on their tripping current:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Sensitivity:</strong> 10mA or 30mA, used for socket outlets and portable equipment</li>
            <li><strong>Medium Sensitivity:</strong> 100mA or 300mA, used for distribution boards and larger appliances</li>
            <li><strong>Low Sensitivity:</strong> 500mA or 1A, used for large industrial equipment</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>RCCBs are crucial safety devices in modern electrical systems. They provide an essential layer of protection against electric shocks and electrical fires, making them indispensable in both residential and industrial settings. Understanding the different types and their applications can help ensure the right level of protection for various electrical installations.</p>

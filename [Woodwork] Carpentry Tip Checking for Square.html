    <h1>Carpentry Tip: How to Check for Square</h1>
    
    <div class="tip-box">
        <p>This simple yet effective method, known as the "3-4-5 rule" or "Pythagorean triple," is a quick way to check if corners are square without using specialized tools.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Materials Needed:</h2>
    <div class="materials-list">
        <ul>
            <li>Measuring tape</li>
            <li>Pencil</li>
            <li>The object or surface you want to check for square</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Measure along one edge</h3>
        <p>Starting from the corner you want to check, measure and mark 3 units (e.g., 3 feet or 30 inches) along one edge.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Measure along the perpendicular edge</h3>
        <p>From the same corner, measure and mark 4 units along the edge perpendicular to the first measurement.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Measure the diagonal</h3>
        <p>Measure the distance between the two marks you made. If the corner is perfectly square, this diagonal measurement should be exactly 5 units.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Check the result</h3>
        <p>If the diagonal measures exactly 5 units, your corner is square. If it's less than 5, the angle is less than 90 degrees. If it's more than 5, the angle is greater than 90 degrees.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip-box">
        <h3>Why this works:</h3>
        <p>This method is based on the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²). In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (longest side) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides. 3² + 4² = 5², which is why these numbers work perfectly for checking square corners.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can use any multiple of 3-4-5 for larger projects (e.g., 6-8-10, 9-12-15).</li>
        <li>For small projects, you can use centimeters or inches instead of feet.</li>
        <li>Always measure carefully and precisely for the most accurate results.</li>
        <li>This method works for checking square corners on floors, walls, frames, and many other carpentry projects.</li>
    </ul>

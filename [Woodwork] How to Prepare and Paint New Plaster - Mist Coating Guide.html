    <h1>How to Prepare and Paint New Plaster - Mist Coating Guide</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Painting new plaster requires patience and the right technique to achieve a professional finish. This guide will walk you through the process of preparing and painting new plaster, including the crucial mist coating step.</p>

    <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Paint brushes and rollers</li>
        <li>Paint tray</li>
        <li>Sandpaper (fine grit)</li>
        <li>Dust sheets</li>
        <li>Masking tape</li>
        <li>Water-based emulsion paint</li>
        <li>Clean water</li>
        <li>Bucket</li>
        <li>Stirring stick</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Allow the Plaster to Dry</h3>
        <p>Before painting, ensure the new plaster is completely dry. This typically takes 4-6 weeks, depending on the thickness and environmental conditions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Warning</h3>
        <p>Painting on damp plaster can lead to peeling, blistering, and other issues. Be patient and wait for the plaster to dry thoroughly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Surface</h3>
        <p>Once dry, lightly sand the plaster surface with fine-grit sandpaper to remove any bumps or imperfections. Wipe away dust with a dry cloth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Protect Surrounding Areas</h3>
        <p>Cover floors and furniture with dust sheets. Use masking tape to protect areas you don't want to paint, such as skirting boards and window frames.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Mist Coat</h3>
        <p>Create a mist coat by diluting water-based emulsion paint with water. The ratio should be approximately 70% paint to 30% water. Mix thoroughly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p>The mist coat helps the subsequent layers of paint adhere better to the plaster and reduces the risk of peeling.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Apply the Mist Coat</h3>
        <p>Using a roller or brush, apply the mist coat evenly across the plaster surface. Work in sections, maintaining a wet edge to avoid visible lines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Allow to Dry</h3>
        <p>Let the mist coat dry completely. This usually takes 24 hours, but can vary depending on temperature and humidity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Apply Top Coats</h3>
        <p>Once the mist coat is dry, apply your chosen paint color. You may need 2-3 coats for full coverage. Allow each coat to dry before applying the next.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p>For best results, use a paint specifically designed for new plaster. These often have better adhesion properties.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By following these steps and using a mist coat, you can achieve a professional finish when painting new plaster. Remember, patience is key â€“ allowing proper drying times between coats will result in a longer-lasting, better-looking paint job.</p>

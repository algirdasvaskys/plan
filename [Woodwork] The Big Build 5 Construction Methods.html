    <h1>The Big Build 5: Construction Methods</h1>
    
    <p>In the construction industry, "The Big Build 5" refers to five essential methods for ensuring a strong, stable, and well-executed building project. These methods focus on creating a solid foundation and framework for large-scale constructions.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Good Hardcore</h2>
    <div class="method">
        <p>"Good Hardcore" refers to the use of high-quality, compacted aggregate material as a foundation layer. This method involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Selecting durable, crushed stone or recycled concrete</li>
            <li>Layering and compacting the material to create a stable base</li>
            <li>Ensuring proper drainage to prevent water accumulation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>2. Perfect Levels</h2>
    <div class="method">
        <p>"Perfect Levels" emphasizes the importance of precise leveling in construction. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using laser levels and other advanced tools for accuracy</li>
            <li>Ensuring floors, walls, and ceilings are perfectly horizontal or vertical</li>
            <li>Regularly checking and adjusting levels throughout the construction process</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>3. Square Corners</h2>
    <div class="method">
        <p>"Square Corners" focuses on achieving precise 90-degree angles in construction. This method involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using squares and other measuring tools to check angles</li>
            <li>Ensuring walls meet at perfect right angles</li>
            <li>Maintaining squareness in framing, flooring, and other structural elements</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>4. Ready for the Big Erection</h2>
    <div class="method">
        <p>This phrase refers to preparing the site and materials for the main construction phase. It includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organizing and staging materials efficiently</li>
            <li>Ensuring all necessary equipment is on-site and operational</li>
            <li>Coordinating teams and subcontractors for smooth execution</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>5. Comprehensive Planning</h2>
    <div class="method">
        <p>The fifth method emphasizes thorough planning and documentation. This involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing detailed blueprints and construction documents</li>
            <li>Creating a comprehensive project timeline</li>
            <li>Establishing clear communication channels among all stakeholders</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>By following these five methods, construction teams can ensure a more efficient, stable, and successful building project.</p>

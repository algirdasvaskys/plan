    <h1>Low-Cost Heating, Hot Water, and MVHR for Ultimate Garden Room</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Low-Cost Heating Solutions</h2>
        <p>Efficient heating is crucial for a comfortable garden room. Here are some low-cost options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Electric Panel Heaters:</strong> Energy-efficient and easy to install.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrared Heating Panels:</strong> Provide direct heat to objects and people, energy-efficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Portable Oil-Filled Radiators:</strong> Good for smaller spaces, can be moved around.</li>
            <li><strong>Underfloor Heating:</strong> Efficient for larger areas, provides even heat distribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Combine heating solutions with good insulation to maximize efficiency and reduce costs.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Low-Cost Hot Water Solutions</h2>
        <p>Providing hot water in a garden room can be challenging. Consider these options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Point-of-Use Electric Water Heater:</strong> Small, efficient, and perfect for single sinks.</li>
            <li><strong>Solar Water Heating:</strong> Eco-friendly option, requires initial investment but low running costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat Pump Water Heater:</strong> Energy-efficient, works well in warmer climates.</li>
            <li><strong>Tankless Water Heater:</strong> Provides hot water on demand, saves space and energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Choose a water heating solution based on your specific needs and usage patterns.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. MVHR (Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery)</h2>
        <p>MVHR systems provide fresh air while retaining heat, ideal for well-insulated garden rooms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Extracts stale air, transfers its heat to incoming fresh air.</li>
            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Improves air quality, reduces heating costs, prevents condensation.</li>
            <li><strong>Installation:</strong> Requires professional setup, including ductwork and a heat exchange unit.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Regular filter changes and occasional system checks required.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> MVHR is most effective in airtight, well-insulated spaces. Ensure your garden room meets these criteria.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Integrating Systems for Maximum Efficiency</h2>
        <p>Combine these solutions for an ultimate garden room experience:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use underfloor heating or infrared panels for primary heating.</li>
            <li>Install a point-of-use water heater for hot water needs.</li>
            <li>Implement MVHR for fresh air and heat retention.</li>
            <li>Add smart controls to manage all systems efficiently.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="tip">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Consider consulting with a professional to design an integrated system that meets your specific needs and local regulations.</p>

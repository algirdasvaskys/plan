    <h1>The Big Build: Building a Gable in Stud and OSB</h1>
    <h2>Episode 33 - Comprehensive Guide</h2>

    <p>This guide will walk you through the process of building a gable using studs and Oriented Strand Board (OSB). A gable is the triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches.</p>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Safety First:</strong> Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including safety glasses, gloves, and a hard hat. Use caution when working at heights and with power tools.
    </div>

    <h2>Materials Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2x4 studs</li>
        <li>OSB sheets</li>
        <li>Nails or screws</li>
        <li>Hammer or screw gun</li>
        <li>Circular saw</li>
        <li>Measuring tape</li>
        <li>Pencil</li>
        <li>Level</li>
        <li>Framing square</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Build a Gable:</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Measure and Plan</h3>
        <p>Measure the width of the wall where the gable will be installed. Determine the pitch of your roof to calculate the height of the gable peak.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Cut the Bottom Plate</h3>
        <p>Cut a 2x4 to the width of the wall. This will serve as the bottom plate of your gable frame.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Cut the Top Plates</h3>
        <p>Cut two 2x4s to form the angled top plates of the gable. These should match the roof pitch and meet at the peak.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Install the Plates</h3>
        <p>Secure the bottom plate to the wall. Temporarily brace the top plates in position, ensuring they're level and properly aligned.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Cut and Install Studs</h3>
        <p>Measure and cut 2x4 studs to fit between the bottom and top plates. Install these vertically at 16-inch intervals (or as per local building codes).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Install Blocking</h3>
        <p>Add horizontal blocking between studs for additional support, especially in larger gables.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Measure and Cut OSB</h3>
        <p>Measure the framed gable area and cut OSB sheets to fit. Remember to account for any openings like windows or vents.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Install OSB Sheathing</h3>
        <p>Starting from the bottom, install the OSB sheets onto the frame. Secure with nails or screws at 6-inch intervals along the edges and 12-inch intervals in the field.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 9: Cut Excess</h3>
        <p>If there's any overhang, use a circular saw to trim the excess OSB along the roofline.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 10: Prepare for Finishing</h3>
        <p>Your gable frame is now ready for weatherproofing and exterior finishing as per your house design.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For larger gables, consider using pre-engineered gable trusses for added strength and easier installation.
    </div>

    <p>Remember, building codes can vary by location. Always check local regulations and obtain necessary permits before starting your project.</p>

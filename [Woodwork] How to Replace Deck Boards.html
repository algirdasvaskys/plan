            <li>Pry bar</li>
            <li>Hammer</li>
            <li>Circular saw</li>
            <li>Drill with screwdriver bits</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="materials">
        <h2>Materials:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>New deck boards</li>
            <li>Deck screws</li>
            <li>Wood preservative (if using untreated wood)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Inspect and Measure</h3>
        <p>Carefully inspect your deck to identify damaged or rotting boards. Measure the length and width of the boards you need to replace, and purchase new boards accordingly.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Remove Old Boards</h3>
        <p>Using a pry bar, carefully remove the damaged boards. Start at one end and work your way along the board, prying it up from each joist. Be cautious not to damage surrounding boards or the deck structure.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Inspect and Repair Joists</h3>
        <p>With the old boards removed, inspect the joists for any damage or rot. Replace or repair any compromised joists before installing new deck boards.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Prepare New Boards</h3>
        <p>If using untreated wood, apply wood preservative to all sides of the new boards, including cut ends. Allow the preservative to dry completely before installation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Cut New Boards to Size</h3>
        <p>Measure and mark your new boards to match the length of the old ones. Use a circular saw to cut the boards to size, ensuring straight and accurate cuts.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Position New Boards</h3>
        <p>Place the new boards in position, ensuring they are properly aligned with adjacent boards. Use spacers if necessary to maintain consistent gaps between boards for proper drainage.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Secure New Boards</h3>
        <p>Using a drill and deck screws, secure the new boards to each joist. Place two screws at each joist intersection, about 3/4 inch from the board edges to prevent splitting.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Sand and Finish</h3>
        <p>If necessary, sand the new boards to ensure a smooth surface. Apply an appropriate finish or stain to match the rest of your deck, following the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Always wear safety glasses and work gloves when removing old boards and installing new ones.</li>
        <li>Check local building codes to ensure compliance with regulations.</li>
        <li>Consider replacing multiple boards at once if your deck shows signs of widespread wear.</li>
        <li>Use boards of the same thickness as the original deck boards to maintain a level surface.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>By following these steps, you can successfully replace damaged deck boards and maintain the safety and appearance of your outdoor space.</p>

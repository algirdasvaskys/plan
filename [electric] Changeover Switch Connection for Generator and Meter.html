    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A changeover switch is used to switch between two power sources, typically the main utility power supply and a backup generator. This guide will walk you through the process of connecting a changeover switch for a generator and meter.</p>

    <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Changeover switch (appropriately rated for your system)</li>
        <li>Cables (sized appropriately for your electrical load)</li>
        <li>Circuit breakers</li>
        <li>Screwdrivers</li>
        <li>Wire strippers</li>
        <li>Electrical tape</li>
        <li>Multimeter</li>
        <li>Personal protective equipment (PPE)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Ensure all power sources are turned off before beginning work. Wear appropriate PPE.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Install the Changeover Switch:</strong> Mount the changeover switch in a suitable location, typically near your main electrical panel.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Connect the Main Power Supply:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Connect the main power supply lines to the "Mains" terminals on the changeover switch.</li>
                <li>typically labeled as L1, L2, L3 (for three-phase systems) and N for neutral.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Connect the Generator:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Connect the generator output to the "Generator" terminals on the changeover switch.</li>
                <li>Ensure proper phasing if using a three-phase system.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Connect the Load:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Connect the load terminals from the changeover switch to your main distribution board.</li>
                <li>This will typically involve connecting to the main breaker in your electrical panel.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Install Circuit Breakers:</strong> Install appropriate circuit breakers for both the mains and generator inputs.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Ground Connections:</strong> Ensure all ground connections are properly made and secure.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Double-Check Connections:</strong> Verify all connections are tight and correctly made according to the changeover switch manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a multimeter to check for continuity and proper voltage levels.</li>
                <li>Slowly energize the system, checking for any signs of problems.</li>
                <li>Test the changeover mechanism to ensure it switches between power sources correctly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Label the System:</strong> Clearly label all components and provide instructions for operation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Operation</h2>
    <p>To operate the changeover switch:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>During normal operation, the switch should be set to "Mains".</li>
        <li>If there's a power outage, start your generator.</li>
        <li>Once the generator is running steadily, switch the changeover switch to "Generator".</li>
        <li>When mains power is restored, switch back to "Mains" before turning off the generator.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Maintenance</h2>
    <p>Regular maintenance is crucial:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Periodically check all connections for tightness and signs of wear.</li>
        <li>Test the system monthly to ensure proper operation.</li>
        <li>Keep the area around the changeover switch clean and dry.</li>
        <li>Follow the manufacturer's maintenance schedule and recommendations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> If you're unsure about any part of this process, consult a qualified electrician. Improper installation can lead to equipment damage, electrical fires, or personal injury.</p>

    <h1>Inverter Connection for Home Wiring</h1>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Working with electrical systems can be dangerous. Always consult a licensed electrician for proper installation and to ensure compliance with local electrical codes.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>An inverter is a device that converts DC (Direct Current) power from batteries into AC (Alternating Current) power for use in homes during power outages. This guide will explain the basic steps for connecting an inverter to your home's electrical system.</p>
    
    <h2>Steps for Inverter Connection</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Inverter</h3>
        <p>Select an inverter that matches your power needs. Consider factors such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Power rating (VA or Watts)</li>
                <li>Input voltage (usually 12V, 24V, or 48V DC)</li>
                <li>Output voltage (usually 120V or 230V AC)</li>
                <li>Pure sine wave vs. modified sine wave output</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Install a Transfer Switch</h3>
        <p>A transfer switch is crucial for safely connecting the inverter to your home's electrical system. It prevents backfeeding, which can be dangerous to utility workers. Install the transfer switch between your main electrical panel and the circuits you want to power with the inverter.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Connect the Inverter to Batteries</h3>
        <p>
            1. Ensure the inverter is OFF.<br>
            2. Connect the positive (red) terminal of the inverter to the positive terminal of the battery.<br>
            3. Connect the negative (black) terminal of the inverter to the negative terminal of the battery.<br>
            4. Use appropriate gauge cables based on the inverter's power rating and the distance between the inverter and batteries.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Connect the Inverter to the Transfer Switch</h3>
        <p>
            1. Run appropriate gauge wire from the AC output of the inverter to the transfer switch.<br>
            2. Connect the hot (usually black or red) wire to the designated terminal on the transfer switch.<br>
            3. Connect the neutral (usually white) wire to the neutral bar in the transfer switch.<br>
            4. Connect the ground (usually green or bare copper) wire to the grounding bar in the transfer switch.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Connect the Transfer Switch to the Main Panel</h3>
        <p>
            1. Identify the circuits you want to power with the inverter.<br>
            2. Move these circuit breakers to the transfer switch panel.<br>
            3. Connect the appropriate wires from the transfer switch to these circuits in the main panel.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Test the System</h3>
        <p>
            1. Turn on the inverter.<br>
            2. Switch the transfer switch to the inverter position.<br>
            3. Test each circuit to ensure it's receiving power from the inverter.<br>
            4. Switch back to utility power and ensure everything works correctly.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Maintenance and Safety</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Regularly inspect batteries and connections for corrosion or damage.</li>
        <li>Keep the inverter and batteries in a well-ventilated area.</li>
        <li>Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for maintenance and operation.</li>
        <li>Never attempt to modify or repair the inverter yourself unless you're qualified to do so.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Remember:</strong> This guide provides a general overview. Always consult with a professional electrician and follow local electrical codes for a safe and proper installation.

    <h1>Setting Out Roof Timbers with a Simplified Metric Roof Framing Square</h1>

    <p>This guide will walk you through the process of setting out roof timbers using a simplified metric roof framing square. This method is particularly useful for carpenters and DIY enthusiasts working on roof construction projects.</p>

    <h2>What is a Roof Framing Square?</h2>
    <p>A roof framing square, also known as a rafter square or framing square, is an L-shaped tool used in carpentry to lay out rafters, stair stringers, and other angled cuts. The simplified metric version typically has measurements in millimeters and degrees.</p>

    <h2>Steps to Set Out Roof Timbers</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Determine the Roof Pitch</h3>
        <p>Before you begin, you need to know the roof pitch. This is usually expressed as a ratio, such as 4:12 (rises 4 units for every 12 units of horizontal run).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Position the Square</h3>
        <p>Place the square on the timber with the longer arm (blade) along the top edge of the timber and the shorter arm (tongue) perpendicular to it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Find the Correct Markings</h3>
        <p>On the blade of the square, find the marking that corresponds to your roof pitch. For example, if your roof pitch is 4:12, find the 4 on the blade.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Mark the Plumb Cut</h3>
        <p>With the square positioned correctly, draw a line along the tongue of the square. This line represents the plumb cut (vertical cut) of your rafter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Mark the Bird's Mouth</h3>
        <p>The bird's mouth is the notch cut into the rafter that sits on the wall plate. To mark this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure the width of the wall plate from the plumb line.</li>
            <li>Make a mark at this point on the bottom edge of the rafter.</li>
            <li>Use the square to draw a vertical line up from this mark to intersect with the top edge of the rafter.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Mark the Tail Cut</h3>
        <p>The tail cut is the angled cut at the overhanging end of the rafter. Position the square as in step 2, but this time at the end of the rafter, and mark along the blade.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Cut the Timber</h3>
        <p>Using a saw, carefully cut along all the lines you've marked. Always double-check your measurements before cutting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Safety Warning</h3>
        <p>Always wear appropriate safety gear, including safety glasses and gloves, when working with power tools. Ensure your work area is well-lit and free from obstacles.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Tips for Using a Metric Roof Framing Square</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep your square clean and free from debris for accurate measurements.</li>
        <li>Use a sharp pencil for precise markings.</li>
        <li>Double-check all measurements before cutting.</li>
        <li>For complex roofs, consider creating a template rafter first.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember, practice makes perfect. The more you use your roof framing square, the more comfortable and proficient you'll become with it. Always prioritize safety and accuracy in your carpentry projects.</p>

    <h1>MY2N, MY3N & MY4N Type Relay Circuit Diagram and Connection</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>MY2N, MY3N, and MY4N are types of electromechanical relays commonly used in industrial control applications. These relays are known for their reliability and versatility. This document provides a comprehensive guide to their circuit diagrams and connection methods.</p>
    
    <h2>Relay Types</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>MY2N:</strong> Double Pole Double Throw (DPDT) relay</li>
        <li><strong>MY3N:</strong> Three Pole Double Throw (3PDT) relay</li>
        <li><strong>MY4N:</strong> Four Pole Double Throw (4PDT) relay</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Circuit Diagram</h2>
    <div class="diagram">
        <!-- SVG diagram would go here. As we can't use external images, I'll describe it textually. -->
        [Circuit diagram showing the internal connections of MY2N, MY3N, and MY4N relays. The diagram includes coil terminals, normally open (NO) contacts, normally closed (NC) contacts, and common terminals for each pole.]
    </div>
    
    <h2>Connection Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Coil Connection:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Locate the coil terminals (usually marked as A1 and A2).</li>
                <li>Connect the positive voltage to A1 and negative (or ground) to A2, unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Contact Connections:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>MY2N: Has two sets of changeover contacts.</li>
                <li>MY3N: Has three sets of changeover contacts.</li>
                <li>MY4N: Has four sets of changeover contacts.</li>
                <li>Each set consists of a Common (C), Normally Open (NO), and Normally Closed (NC) terminal.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wiring:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Connect the load circuit to the appropriate terminals based on your application needs.</li>
                <li>Use the NO contact if you want the circuit to close when the relay is energized.</li>
                <li>Use the NC contact if you want the circuit to open when the relay is energized.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="note">
        <h3>Important Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Always ensure the relay's voltage and current ratings match your application requirements.</li>
            <li>Use appropriate wire gauge for the current in your circuit.</li>
            <li>Follow all local electrical codes and safety regulations when installing relays.</li>
            <li>If switching high voltages or currents, consider using additional protective devices like fuses or circuit breakers.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>These relays are commonly used in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Industrial control systems</li>
        <li>HVAC systems</li>
        <li>Automotive applications</li>
        <li>Power distribution</li>
        <li>Safety interlocking systems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>MY2N, MY3N, and MY4N relays offer flexible and reliable switching solutions for various applications. Proper understanding of their circuit diagrams and connection methods is crucial for effective and safe implementation in your projects.</p>

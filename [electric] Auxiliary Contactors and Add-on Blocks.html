    <h1>Auxiliary Contactors and Add-on Blocks in Electrical Systems</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Auxiliary Contactors</h2>
        <p>Auxiliary contactors are essential components in electrical control systems. They are used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Control Circuits: To switch control circuits on and off.</li>
            <li>Status Indication: To provide status information about the main contactor.</li>
            <li>Interlocking: To create logical interlocks between different parts of a system.</li>
            <li>Multiplying Contacts: To increase the number of available contacts for complex control schemes.</li>
            <li>Low Current Switching: For switching small loads or signals that the main contactor isn't designed to handle.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Add-on Blocks in Contactors</h2>
        <p>Add-on blocks are modular components that can be attached to main contactors. They serve several purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flexibility: Allow for easy customization of contactor functionality.</li>
            <li>Space Saving: Compact design saves panel space compared to separate components.</li>
            <li>Time Delay: Some add-on blocks provide time delay functions for sequencing operations.</li>
            <li>Additional Contacts: Increase the number of auxiliary contacts available.</li>
            <li>Special Functions: Can add features like overload protection or phase failure detection.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Benefits of Using Auxiliary Contactors and Add-on Blocks</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Increased Functionality: Expand the capabilities of basic contactors.</li>
            <li>Simplified Wiring: Reduce the complexity of control circuit wiring.</li>
            <li>Modularity: Easy to add or change functions without replacing the entire contactor.</li>
            <li>Cost-Effective: Often cheaper than using separate components for each function.</li>
            <li>Reliability: Designed to work seamlessly with the main contactor, ensuring reliable operation.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>Auxiliary contactors and add-on blocks are commonly used in:</p>

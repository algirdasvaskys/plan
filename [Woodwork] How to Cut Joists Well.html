        <h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
        <div class="safety">
            <ul>
                <li>Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).</li>
                <li>Ensure your work area is well-lit and free from obstacles.</li>
                <li>Inspect your tools before use, especially the circular saw blade.</li>
                <li>Keep your hands away from the cutting path of the saw.</li>
                <li>Secure the joist properly before cutting to prevent movement.</li>
                <li>Unplug the saw when changing blades or making adjustments.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Cutting Joists</h2>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 1: Measure and Mark</strong>
            <p>Carefully measure the joist and mark your cutting line using a measuring tape and carpenter's pencil. Double-check your measurements to ensure accuracy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 2: Use a Speed Square</strong>
            <p>Place a speed square along the marked line to ensure it's perfectly straight and square to the joist's edge. Trace along the speed square with your pencil for a precise cutting line.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 3: Set Up Sawhorses</strong>
            <p>Position your sawhorses and place the joist securely on top. Ensure the section you're cutting extends beyond the sawhorse for a clean cut.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 4: Adjust the Saw Blade</strong>
            <p>Set the depth of your circular saw blade to slightly more than the thickness of the joist. This ensures a complete cut without damaging the surface beneath.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 5: Make the Cut</strong>
            <p>Start the saw and carefully guide it along the marked line. Keep the saw's baseplate flush against the joist's surface for a straight cut. Move at a steady pace, allowing the saw to do the work without forcing it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 6: Support the Cut End</strong>
            <p>As you near the end of the cut, have a helper support the cut-off end to prevent it from falling and potentially causing the joist to split.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 7: Sand the Cut Edge</strong>
            <p>Once the cut is complete, lightly sand the cut edge to remove any splinters or rough spots.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Cuts</h2>
        <div class="tip">
            <ul>
                <li>Use a sharp, high-quality blade designed for cutting wood.</li>
                <li>Cut on the waste side of your line to account for the blade's width.</li>
                <li>For repetitive cuts, create a jig to ensure consistency.</li>
                <li>Take your time and focus on maintaining a steady hand throughout the cut.</li>
                <li>If cutting multiple joists, measure and mark them all at once to ensure consistency.</li>
                <li>Consider using a guide rail or straight edge for extra-long cuts.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Cutting joists well requires careful planning, precise measurement, and safe execution. By following these steps and tips, you'll be able to make clean, accurate cuts that contribute to the overall quality and durability of your construction project. Remember, practice makes perfect, so take your time and don't hesitate to make test cuts on scrap wood before cutting your actual joists.</p>

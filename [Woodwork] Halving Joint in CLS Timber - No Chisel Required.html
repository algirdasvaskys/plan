    <h1>Creating a Halving Joint in CLS Timber Without a Chisel</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A halving joint is a simple and strong woodworking joint where two pieces of timber are joined by removing half the thickness of each piece where they overlap. This guide will show you how to create this joint using CLS (Canadian Lumber Standard) timber without the need for a chisel.</p>
    
    <h2>Tools Required</h2>
    <div class="tool">
        <ul>
            <li>Circular saw or table saw</li>
            <li>Measuring tape</li>
            <li>Pencil</li>
            <li>Square</li>
            <li>Sandpaper (medium and fine grit)</li>
            <li>Safety glasses</li>
            <li>Dust mask</li>
            <li>Hearing protection</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <div class="material">
        <ul>
            <li>Two pieces of CLS timber (size depends on your project)</li>
            <li>Wood glue (optional)</li>
            <li>Wood screws (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Measure and Mark</h3>
        <p>Measure the width of your CLS timber. Mark the halfway point on both pieces where you want the joint to be. Use a square to draw a line across the width of the timber at this point.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Set Up Your Saw</h3>
        <p>Set the depth of your circular saw or table saw to exactly half the thickness of your CLS timber. This is crucial for creating a flush joint.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Make Multiple Cuts</h3>
        <p>Starting from your marked line, make multiple parallel cuts along the length of the timber up to where you want the joint to end. Space these cuts about 1/8 inch apart.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Remove the Waste</h3>
        <p>After making the cuts, the waste material should be easy to remove. You may need to use a flat screwdriver or the claw of a hammer to pry out any stubborn pieces.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Clean Up</h3>
        <p>Use sandpaper to smooth out the cut area. Start with medium grit and finish with fine grit for a smooth surface.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Test Fit</h3>
        <p>Place the two pieces together to check the fit. They should sit flush with each other. If not, sand down any high spots.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Join the Pieces</h3>
        <p>Once satisfied with the fit, you can join the pieces. For added strength, you can use wood glue and/or screws.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Safety Warning</h3>
        <p>Always wear safety glasses, a dust mask, and hearing protection when using power tools. Ensure your work area is well-ventilated and keep your fingers away from the saw blade at all times.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Creating a halving joint in CLS timber without a chisel is possible with the right approach. This method using a saw creates a clean, precise joint that's suitable for many woodworking projects. Remember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if your first attempt isn't flawless.</p>

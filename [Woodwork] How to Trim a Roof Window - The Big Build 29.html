            <li>Trim pieces (usually provided with the roof window kit)</li>
            <li>Insulation</li>
            <li>Vapor barrier</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Measure and Mark</h3>
        <p>Carefully measure the dimensions of your roof window opening. Mark these measurements on your trim pieces, allowing for a slight overlap to ensure a snug fit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Cut the Trim</h3>
        <p>Using your circular saw or handsaw, cut the trim pieces to size according to your measurements. Make sure to wear safety goggles and a dust mask during this step.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Install Insulation</h3>
        <p>Before installing the trim, add insulation around the window frame to improve energy efficiency. Use a utility knife to cut the insulation to fit snugly around the window.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Apply Vapor Barrier</h3>
        <p>Install a vapor barrier around the window frame to prevent moisture from entering. Make sure it overlaps with the existing vapor barrier in your roof.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Install Bottom Trim</h3>
        <p>Start with the bottom trim piece. Apply a bead of weatherproof sealant along the edge where it will meet the window frame. Position the trim and secure it with screws.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Install Side Trims</h3>
        <p>Next, install the side trim pieces. Apply sealant, position them, and secure with screws. Make sure they're level and flush with the bottom trim.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Install Top Trim</h3>
        <p>Finally, install the top trim piece. This should overlap the side pieces to ensure proper water runoff. Apply sealant and secure with screws.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Seal All Joints</h3>
        <p>Use your caulking gun to apply weatherproof sealant to all joints between trim pieces and where the trim meets the roof and window frame. This step is crucial for preventing water infiltration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 9: Final Inspection</h3>
        <p>Step back and inspect your work. Ensure all trim pieces are secure, level, and properly sealed. Make any necessary adjustments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="safety">
        <h2>Safety Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Always wear appropriate safety gear, including goggles, gloves, and a dust mask.</li>
            <li>Use caution when working at heights. Ensure you have stable footing and use fall protection if necessary.</li>
            <li>Be careful when handling power tools, especially on a roof where balance might be tricky.</li>
            <li>If you're unsure about any part of the process, consult a professional. Improper installation can lead to leaks and damage to your home.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>By following these steps, you should be able to successfully trim your roof window, ensuring a weathertight and attractive finish. Remember, if at any point you feel uncomfortable with the process, it's always best to consult with or hire a professional roofer or window installer.</p>

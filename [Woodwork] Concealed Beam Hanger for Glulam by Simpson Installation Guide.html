    </div>
    
    <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Simpson Strong-Tie Concealed Beam Hanger (appropriate model for your beam size)</li>
        <li>Glulam beam</li>
        <li>Support structure (e.g., wall, beam, or column)</li>
        <li>Fasteners (as specified by Simpson Strong-Tie for your model)</li>
        <li>Drill and drill bits</li>
        <li>Screwdriver or impact driver</li>
        <li>Level</li>
        <li>Pencil or marker</li>
        <li>Measuring tape</li>
        <li>Safety equipment (goggles, gloves, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Installation Steps</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Preparation</h3>
        <p>Ensure the support structure is properly prepared and capable of bearing the load. Verify that you have the correct hanger model for your glulam beam size and load requirements.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Mark the Installation Location</h3>
        <p>Measure and mark the exact location where the beam will be installed on the support structure. Use a level to ensure the marks are perfectly horizontal.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Install the Hanger to the Support Structure</h3>
        <p>Position the hanger on the support structure according to your marks. Drill pilot holes if required, then fasten the hanger securely using the specified fasteners.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Glulam Beam</h3>
        <p>Mark the location on the glulam beam where it will connect with the hanger. This typically involves creating a notch or recess in the beam end to accommodate the concealed portion of the hanger.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Install the Beam</h3>
        <p>Carefully lift the glulam beam and position it onto the installed hanger. Ensure the beam is fully seated in the hanger and level.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Secure the Beam to the Hanger</h3>
        <p>Using the specified fasteners, secure the beam to the hanger. This usually involves driving screws or bolts through pre-drilled holes in the hanger into the beam.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Final Checks</h3>
        <p>Verify that all connections are tight and secure. Check that the beam is level and properly aligned. Make any necessary adjustments.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Maintenance</h2>
    <p>Regularly inspect the connection for any signs of wear, corrosion, or loosening. Address any issues promptly to maintain the structural integrity of the connection.</p>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Note:</strong> This guide provides general instructions. Always refer to the specific installation instructions provided by Simpson Strong-Tie for your particular hanger model, as details may vary.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Proper installation of concealed beam hangers is crucial for both the structural integrity and aesthetic appeal of glulam beam connections. Always prioritize safety and consult professionals when in doubt.</p>

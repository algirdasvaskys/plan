        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            "Acres of Diamonds" is a motivational lecture by Russell H. Conwell that conveys the idea
            that one can find wealth and success in their own community or even within themselves,
            rather than seeking it elsewhere. The central story is about a man who sells his farm to
            search for diamonds, only to find out later that the farm he sold contained a rich diamond
            mine.
        </p>
        <h2>Themes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> The lecture emphasizes that opportunities for success are often
            found in our own backyard, and one should not overlook them while searching for something
            seemingly better.</li>
            <li><strong>Contentment:</strong> It teaches the importance of appreciating what one has and making the
            most of it rather than constantly seeking more.</li>
            <li><strong>Perception:</strong> Conwell encourages individuals to recognize potential and value in what
            they already possess.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Improvement:</strong> The narrative suggests that personal development and hard work
            can lead to success without the need to venture far from home.</li>
        </ul>

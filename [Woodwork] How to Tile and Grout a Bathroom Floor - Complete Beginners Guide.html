        <li>Gloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Floor</h3>
        <p>Ensure the floor is clean, dry, and level. Remove any existing flooring and repair any damages. Use a self-leveling compound if necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Plan Your Layout</h3>
        <p>Measure your bathroom and plan the tile layout. Start from the center of the room and work outwards. Use chalk lines to mark your starting point and guidelines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Apply Adhesive</h3>
        <p>Mix the tile adhesive according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apply it to a small section of the floor using a notched trowel, creating ridges in the adhesive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Lay the Tiles</h3>
        <p>Start laying tiles from the center point, pressing them firmly into the adhesive. Use tile spacers to maintain even gaps between tiles. Cut tiles as needed to fit around obstacles or edges.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Allow Adhesive to Dry</h3>
        <p>Let the adhesive dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically 24-48 hours.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Prepare and Apply Grout</h3>
        <p>Mix the grout according to instructions. Remove tile spacers. Apply grout using a rubber float, working it into the gaps between tiles. Wipe off excess grout with a damp sponge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Clean and Seal</h3>
        <p>Once the grout has dried (usually 24 hours), clean any remaining haze from the tiles with a clean, damp cloth. Apply a grout sealer to protect it from moisture and stains.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Always wear safety gear, including gloves and eye protection.</li>
        <li>Work in small sections to prevent adhesive from drying before you can lay tiles.</li>
        <li>Use a level frequently to ensure tiles are even.</li>
        <li>Allow proper drying time between steps.</li>
        <li>Clean tools immediately after use.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Warning</h3>
        <p>Tiling can be physically demanding and requires careful attention to detail. If you're unsure about any step, consider consulting a professional to avoid costly mistakes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Tiling and grouting your bathroom floor can be a rewarding DIY project. With patience and attention to detail, you can achieve professional-looking results. Remember to take your time, follow each step carefully, and don't hesitate to seek help if needed.</p>

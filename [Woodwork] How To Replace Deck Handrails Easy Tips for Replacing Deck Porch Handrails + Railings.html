            <h3>Remove the Old Railings</h3>
            <p>Start by removing the old railings. Unscrew or pry off the balusters and top rail. Be careful not to damage the deck boards or posts.</p>
            <div class="tip">Tip: Take pictures of the old railing system before removal for reference.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Inspect and Repair Posts</h3>
            <p>Check the condition of the existing posts. If they're damaged or rotted, replace them before installing new railings.</p>
            <div class="warning">Warning: Ensure posts are securely fastened to the deck structure for safety.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Measure and Cut New Railings</h3>
            <p>Measure the distance between posts and cut your new top and bottom rails to size. Allow for any decorative end caps or post wraps.</p>
            <div class="tip">Tip: Cut your rails slightly longer than needed, then trim for a perfect fit.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Install Bottom Rails</h3>
            <p>Attach the bottom rails to the posts. Use a level to ensure they're perfectly horizontal.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Cut and Install Balusters</h3>
            <p>Measure and cut your balusters to the correct length. Space them evenly along the bottom rail, typically no more than 4 inches apart for safety.</p>
            <div class="tip">Tip: Use a scrap piece of wood as a spacer for consistent baluster placement.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Attach Top Rails</h3>
            <p>Place the top rail over the balusters and secure it to the posts. Check for level as you go.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Secure Balusters</h3>
            <p>Fasten each baluster securely to both the top and bottom rails.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Add Finishing Touches</h3>
            <p>Sand any rough edges, fill screw holes with wood filler if desired, and apply paint or stain to match your deck.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Additional Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Check local building codes before starting your project to ensure compliance.</li>
        <li>Consider using pre-made railing kits for easier installation.</li>
        <li>If your deck is high off the ground, install temporary safety railings while working.</li>
        <li>For a modern look, consider cable or glass railings instead of traditional wood balusters.</li>
        <li>Regular maintenance, such as annual cleaning and sealing, will extend the life of your new railings.</li>
    </ul>

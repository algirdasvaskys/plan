    <h1>Overcurrent Relay Connection in Star-Delta Starter</h1>

    <p>Overcurrent relays play a crucial role in protecting electrical motors from damage due to excessive current. In a star-delta starter, the placement of these relays is particularly important to ensure proper protection throughout the starting process.</p>

    <h2>Connection Method</h2>

    <p>In a star-delta starter, the overcurrent relay is typically connected in series with the main contactor. This placement ensures that the relay can monitor the current flowing to the motor in both star and delta configurations.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Important:</strong> The overcurrent relay must be sized and set appropriately to handle both the reduced current during the star connection and the full load current during the delta connection.
    </div>

    <h2>Connection Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Connect the overcurrent relay to the main contactor's input terminals.</li>
        <li>Connect the output terminals of the overcurrent relay to the motor's supply lines.</li>
        <li>Ensure that all three phases pass through the overcurrent relay.</li>
    </ol>

    </div>

    <h2>Key Considerations</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The overcurrent relay should be able to handle the motor's full load current in delta connection.</li>
        <li>Set the relay's trip current to approximately 125% of the motor's full load current.</li>
        <li>Consider using an electronic overload relay for more precise protection and easier adjustment.</li>
        <li>Regular testing and maintenance of the overcurrent relay is essential for reliable operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Benefits of Proper Connection</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Protects the motor from damage due to overcurrent in both starting and running conditions.</li>
        <li>Helps prevent costly downtime and repairs.</li>
        <li>Enhances the overall safety of the electrical system.</li>
        <li>Increases the lifespan of the motor by preventing overheating.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Remember:</strong> Always consult the manufacturer's guidelines and local electrical codes when installing and configuring overcurrent relays in star-delta starters.

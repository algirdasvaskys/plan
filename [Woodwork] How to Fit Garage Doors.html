        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Opening</h3>
        <p>Ensure the garage opening is level and plumb. Measure the width and height of the opening to confirm it matches your door specifications.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Install the Horizontal Track</h3>
        <p>Attach the horizontal track to the vertical track. Secure it to the ceiling with hanging brackets, ensuring it's level.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Install the Vertical Track</h3>
        <p>Position the vertical track on both sides of the door opening. Use a level to ensure they're plumb before securing them with lag screws.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Door Panels</h3>
        <p>If your door comes in sections, assemble them on the ground. Attach hinges between panels as per the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Install the Bottom Panel</h3>
        <p>Place the bottom panel in the door opening. Secure it to the vertical tracks using rollers and brackets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Add Remaining Panels</h3>
        <p>Install the remaining panels one at a time, securing each with rollers and ensuring they interlock properly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Install the Spring System</h3>
        <p>Attach the torsion spring system above the door. This is a critical and potentially dangerous step - consider professional help for this part.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Connect the Lift Cables</h3>
        <p>Attach the lift cables from the bottom brackets to the drums on the torsion shaft.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 9: Adjust and Test</h3>
        <p>Adjust the spring tension and track alignment. Test the door's balance and smooth operation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 10: Install Weather Stripping</h3>
        <p>Add weather stripping around the door to improve insulation and prevent drafts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">

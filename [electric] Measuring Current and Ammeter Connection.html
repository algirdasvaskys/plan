    <h1>How to Measure Current (Amperes) & Why Ammeters are Connected in Series</h1>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <h2>What is Electric Current?</h2>
        <p>Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor. It is measured in amperes (A), which represent the amount of charge flowing past a point in a circuit per second.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>How to Measure Current</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use an ammeter or multimeter set to measure current.</li>
        <li>Ensure the meter's range is appropriate for the expected current.</li>
        <li>Turn off the circuit before connecting the ammeter.</li>
        <li>Connect the ammeter in series with the component you want to measure the current through.</li>
        <li>Turn on the circuit and read the current measurement on the meter.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Safety Warning</h3>
        <p>Always exercise caution when working with electrical circuits. Ensure the circuit is de-energized before making connections, and never exceed the meter's rated capacity.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Why Ammeters are Connected in Series</h2>
    <p>Ammeters are connected in series for several important reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>To measure all the current:</strong> By being in series, all the current flowing through the circuit must pass through the ammeter, ensuring an accurate measurement.</li>
        <li><strong>Low resistance:</strong> Ammeters are designed to have very low internal resistance to minimize their impact on the circuit.</li>
        <li><strong>Voltage drop:</strong> The series connection results in a minimal voltage drop across the ammeter, maintaining circuit integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Circuit continuity:</strong> A series connection maintains the continuity of the circuit, allowing current to flow as normal.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Parallel Connection Issues</h3>
        <p>If an ammeter were connected in parallel:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It would create a low-resistance path, potentially damaging the meter and the circuit.</li>
            <li>The current reading would be inaccurate as only a fraction of the total current would pass through the meter.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Measuring current correctly and safely is crucial in electrical work. Always remember to connect ammeters in series and take necessary safety precautions when working with electrical circuits.</p>

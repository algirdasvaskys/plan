    <h1>MCB vs MCCB: Understanding the Differences</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Both Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs) and Molded Case Circuit Breakers (MCCBs) are essential components in electrical systems, designed to protect circuits from overloads and short circuits. However, they have distinct characteristics and applications.</p>

    <h2>MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker)</h2>
    <p>MCBs are compact circuit protection devices commonly used in residential and small commercial applications.</p>
    <h3>Characteristics:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Smaller size, suitable for distribution boards</li>
        <li>Fixed trip settings</li>
        <li>Typically rated up to 125A</li>
        <li>Breaking capacity usually between 3-10 kA</li>
        <li>Faster operation for small overloads</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MCCB (Molded Case Circuit Breaker)</h2>
    <p>MCCBs are larger, more robust circuit protection devices used in industrial and large commercial applications.</p>
    <h3>Characteristics:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Larger size, suitable for switchboards and panel boards</li>
        <li>Adjustable trip settings</li>
        <li>Rated up to 3000A</li>
        <li>Breaking capacity can reach up to 200 kA</li>
        <li>Better suited for high-current applications</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MCCB Ratings</h2>
    <p>MCCBs come with various ratings that define their operational characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Current Rating:</strong> The maximum continuous current the MCCB can carry without tripping.</li>
        <li><strong>Voltage Rating:</strong> The maximum voltage the MCCB can safely interrupt.</li>
        <li><strong>Breaking Capacity:</strong> The maximum fault current the MCCB can safely interrupt.</li>
        <li><strong>Frame Size:</strong> Refers to the physical size and maximum current rating of the MCCB.</li>
        <li><strong>Trip Unit:</strong> Can be thermal-magnetic or electronic, determining how the MCCB responds to overloads and short circuits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While both MCBs and MCCBs serve the purpose of circuit protection, they are designed for different applications and load requirements. MCBs are more suitable for smaller, residential applications, while MCCBs are better suited for larger, industrial applications with higher current demands and the need for adjustable settings.</p>

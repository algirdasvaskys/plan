    <h1>Ship Beam and Keel Methods</h1>

    <h2>1. Line Keel</h2>
    <div class="definition">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Line Keel is the lowest longitudinal structural member of a ship, extending from bow to stern, upon which the frame of the vessel is erected.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Method:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Design the keel as a continuous structure running the entire length of the ship.</li>
        <li>Ensure the keel is strong enough to withstand the ship's weight and resist longitudinal bending.</li>
        <li>Integrate the keel with the ship's framing system, connecting it to the hull plates and internal structures.</li>
        <li>Use high-strength materials, typically steel, to construct the keel.</li>
        <li>Incorporate flood control measures and access points for maintenance when necessary.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. Latak Beam</h2>
    <div class="definition">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Latak Beam, also known as the Lateral Beam, is a structural member that runs across the width of a ship, providing lateral strength and support.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Method:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Design the latak beam to span the full width of the ship, from port to starboard.</li>
        <li>Calculate the required strength based on the ship's size and expected loads.</li>
        <li>Position latak beams at regular intervals along the length of the ship.</li>
        <li>Integrate the beams with the ship's framing system and deck structures.</li>
        <li>Ensure proper connection to the hull sides for optimal load distribution.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. T Beam</h2>
    <div class="definition">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A T Beam is a structural member with a T-shaped cross-section, used to provide strength and stiffness while minimizing weight.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Method:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Design the T Beam with a vertical web and a horizontal flange.</li>
        <li>Calculate the dimensions of the web and flange based on load requirements.</li>
        <li>Fabricate the T Beam using welding or other joining methods.</li>
        <li>Install T Beams in areas requiring additional strength, such as deck supports or bulkheads.</li>
        <li>Ensure proper alignment and connection to adjacent structural members.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Depth of Beam</h2>
    <div class="definition">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Depth of Beam refers to the vertical dimension of a beam, measured from the top of the upper flange to the bottom of the lower flange.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Method for determining Depth of Beam:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Analyze the loads and span of the beam to determine required strength.</li>
        <li>Calculate the minimum depth required to resist bending moments and shear forces.</li>
        <li>Consider space constraints and weight limitations in the ship's design.</li>
        <li>Use standard beam depth tables or structural engineering software for calculations.</li>
        <li>Adjust depth as necessary to meet both structural and design requirements.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. Size of Beam</h2>
    <div class="definition">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Size of Beam refers to the overall dimensions of a beam, including its depth, width, and length.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Method for determining Size of Beam:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Determine the required load-bearing capacity of the beam.</li>
        <li>Calculate the necessary cross-sectional area to support the load.</li>
        <li>Consider the beam's length based on its placement within the ship's structure.</li>
        <li>Select appropriate width and depth dimensions to achieve the required cross-sectional area.</li>
        <li>Optimize the beam size for weight efficiency while maintaining structural integrity.</li>
        <li>Ensure compatibility with connecting structural members and overall ship design.</li>
    </ol>

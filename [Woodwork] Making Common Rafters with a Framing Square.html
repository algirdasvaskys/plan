    <h1>Making Common Rafters with a Framing Square</h1>
    
    <p>This guide will walk you through the process of making common rafters using a framing square, including how to cut birdsmouths. A framing square is an essential tool for accurately measuring and marking your rafters.</p>
    
    <h2>Tools and Materials Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Framing square</li>
        <li>Pencil</li>
        <li>Tape measure</li>
        <li>Circular saw or handsaw</li>
        <li>Lumber for rafters (typically 2x4, 2x6, or 2x8)</li>
        <li>Safety glasses</li>
        <li>Work gloves</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Determine the Roof Pitch</h3>
        <p>Before you begin, you need to know the roof pitch. This is usually expressed as a ratio, such as 4/12 (4 inches of rise for every 12 inches of run).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Mark the Plumb Cut</h3>
        <p>1. Place the framing square on the rafter board.</p>
        <p>2. Align the number on the tongue (narrow part) that corresponds to the rise of your roof pitch with the edge of the board.</p>
        <p>3. Make sure the 12-inch mark on the body (wider part) of the square is also on the edge of the board.</p>
        <p>4. Draw a line along the tongue. This is your plumb cut line.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Mark the Bird's Mouth</h3>
        <p>1. Measure down from the top edge of the rafter along the plumb cut line the depth of the seat cut (typically 1.5 inches for a 2x4 top plate).</p>
        <p>2. Make a mark at this point.</p>
        <p>3. Place the framing square on the board again, aligning it with this mark and the edge of the board.</p>
        <p>4. Draw a line along the body of the square. This is your seat cut line.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Mark the Tail Cut</h3>
        <p>1. Measure from the plumb cut line to where you want the rafter to end.</p>
        <p>2. Use the framing square to mark another plumb cut line at this point for the tail cut.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Cut the Rafter</h3>
        <p>1. Put on your safety glasses and work gloves.</p>
        <p>2. Using a circular saw or handsaw, carefully cut along the plumb cut lines at both ends of the rafter.</p>
        <p>3. Cut out the bird's mouth by making the plumb cut and seat cut where marked.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Check and Adjust</h3>
        <p>1. Test fit your rafter to ensure it sits properly on the top plate and ridge board.</p>
        <p>2. Make any necessary adjustments.</p>
        <p>3. Use this rafter as a template to mark and cut the remaining rafters.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Always double-check your measurements before cutting.</li>
        <li>The depth of the bird's mouth should not exceed 1/3 of the rafter's depth to maintain structural integrity.</li>
        <li>For more complex roof designs, consider using rafter tables or software to assist with calculations.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Remember, precision is key when making rafters. Take your time with each measurement and cut to ensure a sturdy and well-fitting roof structure.</p>

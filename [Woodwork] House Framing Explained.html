    <h1>House Framing Explained in 12 Minutes</h1>
    
    <p>House framing is the process of creating the skeletal structure of a building. It involves assembling and erecting the structural elements that will support the walls, roof, and floors. This guide will explain the key components and steps involved in house framing.</p>

    <h2>Key Framing Members</h2>

    <div class="framing-member">
        <h3>1. Sill Plate</h3>
        <p>The sill plate is the bottom horizontal member of a wall or building to which vertical members are attached. It's usually pressure-treated to resist moisture and decay.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="framing-member">
        <h3>2. Floor Joists</h3>
        <p>Floor joists are horizontal members that support the floor. They run perpendicular to the foundation walls and are typically spaced 16 or 24 inches apart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="framing-member">
        <h3>3. Rim Joist</h3>
        <p>The rim joist is the outermost joist that caps the ends of the floor joists and forms the perimeter of the floor frame.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="framing-member">
        <h3>4. Wall Studs</h3>
        <p>Wall studs are vertical framing members used to construct walls. They're typically spaced 16 or 24 inches apart and support the wall covering and roof.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="framing-member">
        <h3>5. Top Plate</h3>
        <p>The top plate is the horizontal member that sits atop the wall studs. It's usually doubled for extra strength and to tie the walls together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="framing-member">
        <h3>6. Headers</h3>
        <p>Headers are horizontal beams installed above doors and windows to transfer the load from above to the trimmer studs on either side of the opening.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="framing-member">
        <h3>7. Rafters</h3>
        <p>Rafters are sloping beams that extend from the ridge beam to the top plate, forming the main structure of the roof.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="framing-member">
        <h3>8. Ridge Beam</h3>
        <p>The ridge beam is the highest horizontal member in a roof, where the rafters meet at the peak.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>House Framing Process</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Foundation Preparation</h3>
        <p>Ensure the foundation is level and properly cured. Install anchor bolts for securing the sill plate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Sill Plate Installation</h3>
        <p>Attach the pressure-treated sill plate to the foundation using anchor bolts and washers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Floor Framing</h3>
        <p>Install the rim joists and floor joists. Add blocking between joists for extra support. Lay the subfloor over the joists.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Wall Framing</h3>
        <p>Construct wall frames on the ground, including studs, top and bottom plates, and headers for openings. Raise and secure the walls in place.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Ceiling Joists and Roof Framing</h3>
        <p>Install ceiling joists to support the ceiling and provide a base for roof rafters. Erect rafters and the ridge beam to form the roof structure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Sheathing</h3>
        <p>Apply exterior sheathing to the walls and roof to provide structural strength and a base for siding and roofing materials.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Windows and Doors</h3>
        <p>Install windows and doors in their rough openings, ensuring they're level, plumb, and square.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Inspection</h3>
        <p>Have the framing inspected by a building inspector to ensure it meets local building codes before proceeding with further construction.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This overview covers the basic components and process of house framing. Remember that framing is a complex task that requires skill, knowledge of building codes, and attention to detail. Always consult with professionals or obtain proper training before attempting to frame a house.</p>

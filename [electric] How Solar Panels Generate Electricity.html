    <h1>How Solar Panels Generate Electricity</h1>
    
    <p>Solar panels are an increasingly popular way to generate clean, renewable electricity. But how exactly do they work? Let's break down the process step by step.</p>

    <h2>1. Photovoltaic Effect</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>The core principle behind solar panels is the photovoltaic effect. This effect occurs when certain materials produce an electric current when exposed to light.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Solar Panel Construction</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>Solar panels are made up of many individual solar cells. These cells are typically made of silicon, a semiconductor material. The silicon is treated to create two layers with different electrical properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>N-type layer: Has extra electrons</li>
            <li>P-type layer: Has extra "holes" (absence of electrons)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Light Absorption</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>When sunlight hits the solar panel, photons (particles of light) are absorbed by the silicon material.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>4. Electron Excitation</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>The absorbed photons transfer their energy to electrons in the silicon atoms. This extra energy allows some electrons to break free from their normal positions in the atoms.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Electron Flow</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>The free electrons are attracted to the positively charged P-type layer. However, they can't cross the junction between the N-type and P-type layers directly. Instead, they must flow through an external circuit, creating an electric current.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>6. Conversion to Usable Electricity</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>The electric current produced by the solar cells is direct current (DC). Most household appliances use alternating current (AC). An inverter is used to convert the DC electricity to AC electricity.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>7. Powering Your Home or Feeding the Grid</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>The AC electricity can now be used to power your home. Any excess electricity can be fed back into the power grid or stored in batteries for later use.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Factors Affecting Solar Panel Efficiency</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sunlight intensity and duration</li>
        <li>Panel orientation and tilt</li>
        <li>Temperature (cooler temperatures are generally better)</li>
        <li>Shading</li>
        <li>Dust or debris on the panel surface</li>
        <li>Quality and efficiency of the solar cells</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Solar panels harness the power of the sun to generate clean, renewable electricity through the photovoltaic effect. As technology improves and costs decrease, solar power is becoming an increasingly viable and popular option for both residential and commercial energy needs.</p>

    <h1>Beams and DPC in House Construction</h1>
    
    <div class="beam-type">
        <h2>1. Plinth Beam</h2>
        <p class="purpose">Purpose: To distribute the load of the superstructure evenly and prevent differential settlement.</p>
        <p class="detail">A plinth beam is a horizontal structural member that is constructed at plinth level (usually about 2 feet above ground level). It ties together all the load-bearing walls and columns, creating a solid foundation for the structure above. The plinth beam helps in:
        <ul>
            <li>Preventing cracks in walls due to uneven settlement</li>
            <li>Resisting soil movement and providing stability</li>
            <li>Acting as a barrier against moisture from the ground</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="beam-type">
        <h2>2. Tie Beam</h2>
        <p class="purpose">Purpose: To bind structural elements together and provide lateral stability.</p>
        <p class="detail">A tie beam is a horizontal structural element that connects columns, walls, or other structural members. It can be found at various levels in a building, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Lintel level: Above doors and windows</li>
            <li>Roof level: At the top of walls to support the roof structure</li>
            <li>Intermediate floors: To tie floor joists together</li>
        </ul>
        Tie beams help in:
        <ul>
            <li>Distributing loads evenly across the structure</li>
            <li>Preventing walls from buckling or leaning</li>
            <li>Improving the overall stability of the building</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="beam-type">
        <h2>3. DPC (Damp Proof Course)</h2>
        <p class="purpose">Purpose: To prevent the rise of moisture from the ground into the walls of the building.</p>
        <p class="detail">DPC is not a beam, but a horizontal layer of water-resistant material placed in the walls of a building. It is typically installed:
        <ul>
            <li>Just above ground level</li>
            <li>Below the first layer of bricks or blocks in the wall</li>
        </ul>
        DPC can be made of various materials, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Bitumen-impregnated materials</li>
            <li>Plastic sheets</li>
            <li>Dense cement mortar with waterproofing compounds</li>
        </ul>
        The DPC helps in:
        <ul>
            <li>Preventing rising damp in walls</li>
            <li>Protecting the building from water-related issues like mold and decay</li>
            <li>Maintaining the structural integrity of the building</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="beam-type">
        <h2>4. Slab Beam</h2>
        <p class="purpose">Purpose: To support floor or roof slabs and transfer loads to columns or walls.</p>
        <p class="detail">A slab beam is a structural element that works in conjunction with concrete slabs to form floors or roofs. It can be:
        <ul>
            <li>Cast monolithically with the slab</li>
            <li>Precast and then integrated with the slab</li>
        </ul>
        Slab beams are crucial in:
        <ul>
            <li>Providing support for large floor or roof areas</li>
            <li>Reducing the thickness of slabs, thereby reducing overall building weight</li>
            <li>Allowing for longer spans between supports</li>
            <li>Improving the load-bearing capacity of the floor or roof system</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Understanding these structural elements is crucial for proper house construction. Each plays a vital role in ensuring the stability, durability, and functionality of the building. Always consult with a qualified structural engineer or architect when planning and executing construction projects.</p>

    <h1>Selected Problems & Solutions on Wattmeter</h1>
    
    <h2>Problem 1: Basic Wattmeter Reading</h2>
    <div class="problem">
        <p>A wattmeter connected to a circuit shows a reading of 500 W. What does this indicate about the power consumption of the circuit?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <p>Solution: The wattmeter reading of 500 W directly indicates that the circuit is consuming 500 watts of electrical power. This means that energy is being used at a rate of 500 joules per second.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Problem 2: Calculating Current from Wattmeter Reading</h2>
    <div class="problem">
        <p>A wattmeter connected to a 120 V AC circuit reads 600 W. What is the current flowing through the circuit?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <p>Solution: We can use the power formula to calculate the current:</p>
        <p class="formula">P = V × I</p>
        <p>Where P is power in watts, V is voltage in volts, and I is current in amperes.</p>
        <p>Rearranging the formula: I = P / V</p>
        <p>I = 600 W / 120 V = 5 A</p>
        <p>Therefore, the current flowing through the circuit is 5 amperes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Problem 3: Power Factor Calculation</h2>
    <div class="problem">
        <p>A wattmeter reads 1000 W in an AC circuit. The voltmeter reads 200 V and the ammeter reads 6 A. Calculate the power factor of the circuit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <p>Solution: The power factor (PF) is the ratio of real power to apparent power. We can calculate it using the formula:</p>
        <p class="formula">PF = P / (V × I)</p>
        <p>Where P is the real power (wattmeter reading), V is voltage, and I is current.</p>
        <p>PF = 1000 W / (200 V × 6 A) = 1000 / 1200 = 0.833</p>
        <p>The power factor of the circuit is 0.833 or 83.3%.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Problem 4: Three-Phase Power Measurement</h2>
    <div class="problem">
        <p>A three-phase balanced load is connected to a 400 V (line-to-line) supply. The wattmeter reading is 10 kW. What is the power factor of the load?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <p>Solution: For a balanced three-phase system, we can use the formula:</p>
        <p class="formula">P = √3 × V<sub>L</sub> × I<sub>L</sub> × PF</p>
        <p>Where P is power, V<sub>L</sub> is line voltage, I<sub>L</sub> is line current, and PF is power factor.</p>
        <p>We don't know the current, so we need to use the relationship between line and phase voltages:</p>
        <p class="formula">V<sub>L</sub> = √3 × V<sub>P</sub></p>
        <p>V<sub>P</sub> = 400 / √3 ≈ 230.94 V</p>
        <p>Now we can use: P = 3 × V<sub>P</sub> × I<sub>P</sub> × PF</p>
        <p>10,000 = 3 × 230.94 × I<sub>P</sub> × PF</p>
        <p>I<sub>P</sub> × PF = 10,000 / (3 × 230.94) ≈ 14.43</p>
        <p>We can't determine the exact power factor without knowing the current. The product of current and power factor is 14.43.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Problem 5: Wattmeter Error Correction</h2>
    <div class="problem">
        <p>A wattmeter has a guaranteed accuracy of ±2% of full scale. The full scale reading is 1000 W, and the meter currently reads 400 W. What is the possible range of actual power consumption?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <p>Solution: The maximum error is 2% of the full scale:</p>
        <p>Error = 2% of 1000 W = 0.02 × 1000 W = 20 W</p>
        <p>The actual power could be:</p>
        <p>Minimum: 400 W - 20 W = 380 W</p>
        <p>Maximum: 400 W + 20 W = 420 W</p>
        <p>Therefore, the possible range of actual power consumption is 380 W to 420 W.</p>

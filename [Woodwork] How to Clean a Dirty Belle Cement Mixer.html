    <h2>Materials Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Water supply (hose or bucket)</li>
        <li>Stiff-bristled brush or scraper</li>
        <li>Mild detergent</li>
        <li>Vinegar or citric acid solution</li>
        <li>Clean rags or towels</li>
        <li>Lubricating oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cleaning Process:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Move the mixer to a well-ventilated area, preferably outdoors. Ensure it's on a level surface.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Remove loose debris:</strong> Scrape off any loose cement or debris from the drum, blades, and other surfaces using a scraper or stiff brush.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Initial rinse:</strong> Use a hose or bucket to rinse the inside and outside of the mixer thoroughly with water. This will remove most of the loose dirt and cement residue.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Scrub the drum:</strong> Mix a solution of mild detergent and water. Use this with a stiff-bristled brush to scrub the inside of the drum, paying special attention to the blades and any corners where cement might accumulate.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Clean external surfaces:</strong> Wipe down the external surfaces of the mixer with the detergent solution and a rag.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Rinse thoroughly:</strong> Use clean water to rinse off all the soap and loosened dirt from both the inside and outside of the mixer.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Remove cement buildup:</strong> For stubborn cement residue, create a solution of vinegar or citric acid and water. Apply this to the affected areas and let it sit for 15-20 minutes before scrubbing and rinsing.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Dry the mixer:</strong> Use clean rags or towels to dry all surfaces of the mixer, especially any metal parts to prevent rusting.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Lubricate moving parts:</strong> Apply a thin layer of lubricating oil to any moving parts or pivot points to ensure smooth operation and prevent rust.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Final inspection:</strong> Check that all cement residue has been removed and that the mixer drum rotates freely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Maintenance Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean the mixer after each use to prevent cement from hardening inside.</li>
        <li>Regularly check for signs of wear or damage and address them promptly.</li>
        <li>Store the mixer in a dry place when not in use.</li>
        <li>Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for maintenance and cleaning.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following these steps regularly, you can keep your Belle cement mixer clean and in good working condition, extending its lifespan and ensuring optimal performance.</p>

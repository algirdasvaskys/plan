    <h1>How to Change a Thermostatic Radiator Valve Without Draining The System</h1>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> This process involves working with your heating system. If you're unsure about any step, consult a professional plumber to avoid damage or injury.
    </div>

    <h2>Tools and Materials Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>New thermostatic radiator valve</li>
        <li>Adjustable wrench</li>
        <li>Pipe freezing kit</li>
        <li>Towels or rags</li>
        <li>Bucket</li>
        <li>PTFE tape</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Radiator</h3>
        <p>Turn off the heating system and allow the radiator to cool completely. Close both the lockshield valve (usually covered by a plastic cap at one end of the radiator) and the thermostatic valve you're replacing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2: Freeze the Pipe</h3>
        <p>Use a pipe freezing kit to create an ice plug in the pipe leading to the valve. This prevents water from flowing out when you remove the old valve. Follow the kit's instructions carefully.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3: Remove the Old Valve</h3>
        <p>Once the pipe is frozen, use an adjustable wrench to unscrew the old valve. Have towels and a bucket ready to catch any water that may escape. Remove the valve body from the radiator.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Prepare the New Valve</h3>
        <p>Wrap PTFE tape around the threads of the new valve to ensure a watertight seal. Wind the tape clockwise around the threads, overlapping slightly as you go.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 5: Install the New Valve</h3>
        <p>Carefully screw the new valve into place. Tighten it firmly with the adjustable wrench, but be careful not to overtighten as this could damage the valve or radiator.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 6: Thaw the Pipe</h3>
        <p>Remove the pipe freezing kit and allow the pipe to thaw naturally. This may take 10-15 minutes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 7: Check for Leaks</h3>
        <p>Once thawed, open both the lockshield and the new thermostatic valve. Check for any leaks around the new valve. If you see any, tighten the valve slightly or apply more PTFE tape if necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 8: Bleed the Radiator</h3>
        <p>Use a radiator key to bleed any air from the radiator. Open the bleed valve until water starts to come out, then close it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 9: Balance the System</h3>
        <p>You may need to rebalance your heating system after changing the valve. This involves adjusting the lockshield valves on all radiators to ensure even heat distribution.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Note:</strong> If at any point you're unsure or uncomfortable with the process, stop and call a professional plumber. It's better to be safe than risk damage to your heating system.
